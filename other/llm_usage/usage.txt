I want to filter month>= june and year >=2022
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're working with a dataset and want to filter rows where the month is greater than or equal to June and the year is greater than or equal to 2022, here's how you can do it in Python (Pandas) or R:

Python (Pandas) Example:
import pandas as pd

# Sample DataFrame
data = {
    'year': [2021, 2022, 2022, 2023],
    'month': ['May', 'June', 'July', 'January'],
    'value': [10, 20, 30, 40]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Ensure month is in numeric form
df['month'] = pd.to_datetime(df['month'], format='%B').dt.month

# Filter the data
filtered_df = df[(df['year'] > 2022) | ((

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To filter data in R where the month is greater than or equal to June and the year is greater than or equal to 2022, you can use the dplyr package. Here's an example:

Example in R:
# Load dplyr
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2021, 2022, 2022, 2023),
  month = c("May", "June", "July", "January"),
  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40)
)

# Convert month to numeric format
data$month <- match(data$month, month.name)

# Filter data
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(year > 2022 | (year == 2022 & month >= 6))

print(filtered_data)
Explanation:
Convert Months: The match(data$month, month.name) function converts month names to their numeric equivalents (e.g., "June" becomes 6).
Filter: Use filter to apply the conditions:
year > 2022 includes all years after 2022.
(year == 2022 & month >= 6) ensures only months from June onward in 2022 are included.
Output:
The filtered_data will only include rows satisfying the condition.

mutate(after_prohibit==case_when(year_of_death= 2022 & month>=6)
 )
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To use mutate and case_when in R for your specified condition, you need to correctly structure the logical condition. Here's how to add a new column after_prohibit that evaluates whether the year_of_death is 2022 or later and the month is June or later:

Corrected Code
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  year_of_death = c(2021, 2022, 2022, 2023),
  month = c("May", "June", "July", "January"),
  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40)
)

# Convert month to numeric format
data <- data %>%
  mutate(month = match(month, month.name)) # Convert month to numeric

# Add after_prohibit column
data <- data %>%
  mutate(after_prohibit = case_when(
    year_of_death > 2022 ~ TRUE,                # Any year after 2022
    year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6 ~ TRUE, # 2022 and month >= June
    TRUE ~ FALSE                              # Otherwise FALSE
  ))

print(data)
Explanation:
mutate: Adds a new column called after_prohibit.
case_when: Evaluates multiple conditions:
year_of_death > 2022: Marks rows as TRUE if the year is after 2022.
year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6: Marks rows as TRUE if the year is 2022 and the month is June or later.
TRUE ~ FALSE: Marks all other rows as FALSE.
match: Converts the month column (character) into numeric values corresponding to their positions in month.name.
Output:
For the example input, the resulting data will look like this:

year_of_death	month	value	after_prohibit
2021	5	10	FALSE
2022	6	20	TRUE
2022	7	30	TRUE
2023	1	40	TRUE






You said:
cleaned_data<-cleaned_data|>mutate(after_injunction=case_when(year_of_death= 2022 & month>=6~ 1,1 ~ 0)
 )
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your R code has a small syntax error in the case_when condition. The equality operator in R is ==, not =. Additionally, case_when evaluates conditions sequentially, so your structure is almost correct but needs refinement.

Here’s the corrected version:

Corrected Code:
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data |>
  mutate(after_injunction = case_when(
    year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6 ~ 1, # Set to 1 if year is 2022 and month is June or later
    year_of_death > 2022 ~ 1,             # Set to 1 if year is after 2022
    TRUE ~ 0                              # Set to 0 otherwise
  ))
Explanation:
Logical Operator:
== is used for comparison, while = assigns values.
case_when Conditions:
year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6: Returns 1 if the year is 2022 and the month is June or later.
year_of_death > 2022: Returns 1 if the year is after 2022.
TRUE ~ 0: A fallback condition to set 0 if none of the above conditions are met.
Pipe (|>):
The pipe operator forwards the output of one expression as input to the next.
Result:
This code adds a new column, after_injunction, to the cleaned_data dataset, with values set to 1 or 0 based on your conditions.







You said:
Set to 1 if year is 2022 and month is June or later ,otherwise 0
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to set the after_injunction column to 1 only if the year is 2022 and the month is June or later, and 0 otherwise, here’s the streamlined version of your R code:

Corrected Code:
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data |>
  mutate(after_injunction = case_when(
    year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6 ~ 1, # Set to 1 for 2022 and June or later
    TRUE ~ 0                              # Set to 0 otherwise
  ))
Explanation:
Condition:
year_of_death == 2022 & month >= 6: Evaluates to 1 only if the year is 2022 and the month is June or later.
TRUE ~ 0: The fallback condition assigns 0 to all other rows.
Output: This will create a new column, after_injunction, in your dataset with the desired values.

which state in us is illegal for abortion after 2022.6?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
As of November 2024, following the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June 2022 to overturn Roe v. Wade, several states have enacted laws making abortion illegal or severely restricted. Currently, abortion is almost completely illegal in 12 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia.

These states have implemented near-total bans on abortion, with exceptions varying by state, often limited to cases where the pregnant person's life is at risk. Some states have exceptions for rape or incest, but these are not universally applied.

It's important to note that abortion laws are subject to change due to ongoing legal challenges and legislative actions. For the most current information, consulting official state resources or reputable organizations like the Center for Reproductive Rights is recommended.

You said:
give me the code, as a new variable, show the state is legal abortion or not
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's how you can create a new variable in R to indicate whether abortion is legal or not in each state after June 2022. The example assumes you have a dataset with a state column.

Code Example in R:
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  state = c("Alabama", "California", "Texas", "New York", "Mississippi"),
  value = c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50) # Example values
)

# List of states where abortion is illegal after June 2022
illegal_states <- c("Alabama", "Arkansas", "Idaho", "Indiana", "Kentucky", 
                    "Louisiana", "Mississippi", "Oklahoma", "South Dakota", 
                    "Tennessee", "Texas", "West Virginia")

# Add a new variable
data <- data %>%
  mutate(abortion_legality = if_else(state %in% illegal_states, "Illegal", "Legal"))

# View the data
print(data)
Explanation:
illegal_states:
This is a predefined list of states where abortion is illegal after June 2022.
mutate:
Adds a new variable abortion_legality to the dataset.
if_else:
Checks if the state is in the illegal_states list. If true, assigns "Illegal"; otherwise, assigns "Legal".
Sample Output:
For the example data, the output would be:

state	value	abortion_legality
Alabama	10	Illegal
California	20	Legal
Texas	30	Illegal
New York	40	Legal
Mississippi	50	Illegal
Replace the sample data with your actual dataset to reflect your specific analysis.

2.30 (Unreliable let unrealiable into another variable be unrealiable or not
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a new variable indicating whether a value is marked as "Unreliable" based on the presence of "Unreliable" in a column, you can use the following R code:

Example Code in R:
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  value = c("2.04 (Unreliable)", "2.14 (Unreliable)", "2.26 (Unreliable)", "2.30 (Unreliable)", "2.50"),
  state = c("California", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "Texas"),
  year = c(2022, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2023),
  month = c(9, 9, 12, 12, 6)
)

# Add a new column 'unreliable'
data <- data %>%
  mutate(unreliable = if_else(grepl("Unreliable", value), "Unreliable", "Reliable"))

# View the result
print(data)
Explanation:
grepl:
Searches for the term "Unreliable" in the value column.
Returns TRUE if the term is found and FALSE otherwise.
mutate:
Creates a new variable unreliable based on the condition.
Assigns "Unreliable" if TRUE and "Reliable" otherwise.
Output: This code adds a new column to the dataset indicating whether the value is "Unreliable" or not.
Sample Output:
value	state	year	month	unreliable
2.04 (Unreliable)	California	2022	9	Unreliable
2.14 (Unreliable)	Florida	2021	9	Unreliable
2.26 (Unreliable)	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.30 (Unreliable)	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.50	Texas	2023	6	Reliable
Replace the data with your actual dataset to use this code.

and delete unrealiable in the original one
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To remove the term " (Unreliable)" from the original value column while also creating a new unreliable column to indicate whether the value was unreliable, you can use this R code:

Updated Code
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  value = c("2.04 (Unreliable)", "2.14 (Unreliable)", "2.26 (Unreliable)", "2.30 (Unreliable)", "2.50"),
  state = c("California", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "Texas"),
  year = c(2022, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2023),
  month = c(9, 9, 12, 12, 6)
)

# Modify the dataset
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    unreliable = if_else(grepl("Unreliable", value), "Unreliable", "Reliable"), # Mark reliability
    value = gsub(" \\(Unreliable\\)", "", value) # Remove " (Unreliable)" from the value
  )

# View the updated dataset
print(data)
Explanation:
mutate:
Creates a new column, unreliable, to indicate if the value contains the word "Unreliable."
gsub:
Replaces the substring " (Unreliable)" with an empty string ("") in the value column.
The pattern \\(Unreliable\\) matches " (Unreliable)" literally (escaped parentheses).
Preserves Original Values:
The value column is cleaned, while the unreliability information is stored in the new unreliable column.
Sample Output:
value	state	year	month	unreliable
2.04	California	2022	9	Unreliable
2.14	Florida	2021	9	Unreliable
2.26	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.30	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.50	Texas	2023	6	Reliable
This code achieves both creating the new unreliable column and cleaning the original value column.

death_rate  has this 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If your death_rate column contains values with the pattern (Unreliable) and you want to clean it while also creating a new column to flag reliability, here's how you can do it:

Code for Cleaning death_rate and Adding reliable Column
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  death_rate = c("2.04 (Unreliable)", "2.14 (Unreliable)", "2.26 (Unreliable)", "2.30 (Unreliable)", "2.50"),
  state = c("California", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "Texas"),
  year = c(2022, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2023),
  month = c(9, 9, 12, 12, 6)
)

# Modify the dataset
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    reliable = if_else(grepl("Unreliable", death_rate), "Unreliable", "Reliable"), # Add reliability column
    death_rate = gsub(" \\(Unreliable\\)", "", death_rate) # Clean the death_rate column
  )

# View the updated dataset
print(data)
Explanation:
mutate:
Adds a new column reliable to flag whether the death_rate value contains the word "Unreliable."
gsub:
Cleans the death_rate column by removing " (Unreliable)" from the values.
The regex \\(Unreliable\\) matches the exact pattern, including the space before and parentheses.
Final Output:
The death_rate column is cleaned, and the reliability information is stored in the reliable column.
Sample Output:
death_rate	state	year	month	reliable
2.04	California	2022	9	Unreliable
2.14	Florida	2021	9	Unreliable
2.26	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.30	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.50	Texas	2023	6	Reliable
Replace the death_rate column with your actual data column name for this transformation.

and let death rate be num
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To clean the death_rate column, remove " (Unreliable)", and convert it into a numeric data type, you can use the following R code:

Code Example
library(dplyr)

# Sample data
data <- data.frame(
  death_rate = c("2.04 (Unreliable)", "2.14 (Unreliable)", "2.26 (Unreliable)", "2.30 (Unreliable)", "2.50"),
  state = c("California", "Florida", "Florida", "Florida", "Texas"),
  year = c(2022, 2021, 2021, 2021, 2023),
  month = c(9, 9, 12, 12, 6)
)

# Clean and convert death_rate to numeric
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    reliable = if_else(grepl("Unreliable", death_rate), "Unreliable", "Reliable"), # Add reliability column
    death_rate = gsub(" \\(Unreliable\\)", "", death_rate), # Remove "(Unreliable)"
    death_rate = as.numeric(death_rate) # Convert death_rate to numeric
  )

# View the updated dataset
print(data)
Explanation:
mutate:
Adds a new column, reliable, to indicate if the death_rate was "Unreliable."
Cleans the death_rate column by removing " (Unreliable)" using gsub.
Converts the cleaned death_rate column to numeric using as.numeric.
gsub:
Removes the text " (Unreliable)" from death_rate.
as.numeric:
Converts the cleaned death_rate values into numeric format.
Sample Output:
After running the code:

death_rate	state	year	month	reliable
2.04	California	2022	9	Unreliable
2.14	Florida	2021	9	Unreliable
2.26	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.30	Florida	2021	12	Unreliable
2.50	Texas	2023	6	Reliable
Now the death_rate column is numeric, and the dataset is ready for numerical analysis.

    prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
    seed = 853
  ) improve my model
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To improve your Bayesian regression model (stan_glm), consider the following steps:

1. Check Interaction Effects
Your current formula includes an interaction between after_injunction and abortion_legality. Ensure this interaction makes sense theoretically and in practice. If not, remove it or test for significance before including it.

Updated Formula:
With interaction (if relevant):
death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_legality + state + year_of_death
Without interaction (if unnecessary):
death_rate ~ after_injunction + abortion_legality + state + year_of_death
2. Scale Continuous Variables
Scale numeric variables like year_of_death to improve model convergence and interpretability.

analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(year_of_death_scaled = scale(year_of_death))
Update the formula to use year_of_death_scaled instead of year_of_death.

3. Simplify Categorical Variables
If state has many levels, it can lead to overparameterization. Group less relevant states or consider using hierarchical modeling for state as a group-level effect.

4. Adjust Priors
Your current priors (normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)) are relatively weakly informative, which might be suitable for a first attempt. However, you can:

Use domain-specific knowledge to adjust priors.
Increase the scale for variables where you expect larger effects or decrease it for more conservative estimates.
For example:

prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 1.5, autoscale = TRUE)
5. Inspect Residuals and Fit
After fitting the model, examine residuals and goodness-of-fit. If the residuals show heteroskedasticity, consider a different family (e.g., student_t or gamma).

6. Add Random Effects (Hierarchical Modeling)
If state or another grouping variable significantly impacts death_rate, use a random intercept model. Switch to stan_glmer:

library(rstanarm)

first_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_legality + (1 | state) + year_of_death_scaled,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)
7. Cross-Validation
Use leave-one-out cross-validation (loo) or k-fold CV to assess model performance and compare alternative specifications.

library(loo)
loo_first_model <- loo(first_model)
print(loo_first_model)
8. Model Diagnostics
Check diagnostics to ensure proper model convergence:

Effective sample size (n_eff).
R-hat values (should be near 1).
Trace plots for posterior distributions.
Updated Model Code:
Here’s the improved model, incorporating the above suggestions:

library(rstanarm)
library(dplyr)

# Preprocess the data
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(year_of_death_scaled = scale(year_of_death))

# Fit the model
first_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_legality + (1 | state) + year_of_death_scaled,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)

# Cross-validation
loo_first_model <- loo(first_model)
print(loo_first_model)
Key Improvements:
Centered and Scaled Continuous Variables: Enhances convergence and interpretability.
Random Effects: Accounts for group-level variability (state).
Adjusted Priors: Incorporates domain knowledge.
Cross-Validation: Validates the model's performance.

how do you interpret DID coefficient if Y is rate?
ChatGPT said:

When interpreting a Difference-in-Differences (DID) coefficient where the dependent variable

Interpret Interaction Terms:

If your DID model includes interaction terms (e.g.,

Log-Transformation (Optional):

If rates vary significantly across units, consider modeling

The error occurs because the cleaned_data data frame contains a column that is a list or matrix, which is not supported by write_csv. The column at index 11 likely contains such data. To fix this:

Steps to Debug and Resolve
Identify the Problematic Column: Use the following code to check the structure of your data frame and identify any list or matrix columns:

sapply(cleaned_data, class)
Look for columns with the class list or matrix. These are the problematic columns.

Convert Problematic Columns: Convert the problematic columns into a format that can be written to a CSV (e.g., character, numeric, or factor).

cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.list), ~ sapply(., toString))) # Convert list to character
If the problematic column is a matrix, flatten or summarize it:

cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.matrix), ~ as.vector(.)))
Recheck Data Structure: Verify that all columns are now compatible:

sapply(cleaned_data, class)
Write CSV Again: Retry saving the data frame to a CSV:

write_csv(cleaned_data, "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
Additional Tips:
If you want to investigate the column causing the issue, try:

which(sapply(cleaned_data, function(x) is.list(x) || is.matrix(x)))
If you do not need the problematic column, you can drop it before saving:

cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>% select(-problematic_column_name)
Replace problematic_column_name with the name of the identified column.

how can i check categorical variables' category
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In R, you can check the categories (levels) of categorical variables in a dataset using the following methods. These are helpful for identifying and understanding the unique values or factor levels in your data.

1. Identify Categorical Variables
First, determine which columns in your dataset are categorical. A categorical variable in R typically has the class factor or character.

# Check the class of each column
sapply(cleaned_data, class)
Look for columns with the class factor or character.

2. View Levels of Factor Variables
For variables that are factors, use levels() to list their categories:

# Check levels of a specific factor variable
levels(cleaned_data$variable_name)
For example:

levels(cleaned_data$state)
3. View Unique Values for Character Variables
If a column is not a factor (e.g., character), use unique() to see all unique values:

unique(cleaned_data$variable_name)
For example:

unique(cleaned_data$abortion_legality)
4. Combine Levels for All Categorical Variables
To programmatically get all categories for every categorical variable:

# List levels for all factor columns
categorical_levels <- sapply(cleaned_data, function(col) {
  if (is.factor(col)) {
    return(levels(col))
  } else if (is.character(col)) {
    return(unique(col))
  } else {
    return(NULL)
  }
})
categorical_levels
This outputs a list of levels or unique values for each categorical variable.

5. Check Frequency of Categories
Use table() or count() from dplyr to check the frequency of each category:

# Frequency table
table(cleaned_data$variable_name)

# Using dplyr
library(dplyr)
cleaned_data %>%
  count(variable_name)
Example:
If state and abortion_legality are categorical variables in your dataset:

# Check levels of `state`
levels(cleaned_data$state)

# Check unique values of `abortion_legality`
unique(cleaned_data$abortion_legality)

# Frequency of `state`
table(cleaned_data$state)
This gives you a clear understanding of the categories in each variable. Let me know if you'd like further assistance!

use eventstudyr to do a event study for my model
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To conduct an event study using the eventstudyr package in R, you can follow these steps. This package is designed for analyzing the impact of an event on a dependent variable.

Here’s a general guide to use eventstudyr for your model:

1. Install and Load Required Packages
Ensure that eventstudyr is installed:

install.packages("eventstudyr")
library(eventstudyr)
2. Prepare Your Data
The eventstudyr package requires specific columns in your data:

An event identifier (e.g., state or group).
A time identifier (e.g., year_of_death).
The dependent variable (e.g., death_rate).
The event date (e.g., after_injunction or similar).
Example: Ensure analysis_data is in the proper format:

# Example data preparation
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    event_date = as.Date(if_else(after_injunction == 1, "2022-06-01", NA_character_)), # Example event date
    time = as.Date(paste0(year_of_death, "-", month, "-01")) # Create a time variable
  )
3. Create an Event Study Model
Using eventstudyr to model the effect of an event on death_rate:

# Define the event window
event_window <- c(-12, 12) # Example: 12 months before and after the event

# Perform event study
event_study_results <- compute_event_study(
  data = analysis_data,
  dependent_var = "death_rate",
  time_var = "time",
  group_var = "state", # Replace with your event identifier
  event_var = "event_date",
  event_window = event_window,
  estimator = lm_estimator
)
4. Visualize Results
Visualize the event study coefficients over the event window:

plot_event_study(event_study_results)
5. Interpretation
The event study results will include:

Estimated coefficients for each time period relative to the event.
Standard errors for these estimates.
A visualization of the impact before, during, and after the event.
Complete Example
Here’s how the complete process looks:

# Load packages
library(eventstudyr)
library(dplyr)

# Prepare data
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    event_date = as.Date(if_else(after_injunction == 1, "2022-06-01", NA_character_)), # Example
    time = as.Date(paste0(year_of_death, "-", month, "-01"))
  )

# Define event window
event_window <- c(-12, 12)

# Compute event study
event_study_results <- compute_event_study(
  data = analysis_data,
  dependent_var = "death_rate",
  time_var = "time",
  group_var = "state",
  event_var = "event_date",
  event_window = event_window,
  estimator = lm_estimator
)

# Plot results
plot_event_study(event_study_results)
Notes:
Replace variables like state, time, and after_injunction with your actual variable names.
Adjust the event_window as needed to fit your analysis.

I have year and month parameter
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Since your data includes year and month parameters, you need to combine them into a date format for eventstudyr. Here's how you can adapt the process to work with year and month.

Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Combine year and month into a Date Column
The eventstudyr package requires a date variable to represent time. Use the as.Date() function to combine year and month:

library(dplyr)

# Combine year and month into a date column
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.Date(paste0(year_of_death, "-", month, "-01")) # Convert to first day of each month
  )
2. Create the Event Variable
Identify when the event (e.g., after_injunction) occurs and set the event_date. For instance, if the event occurs in June 2022:

analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    event_date = as.Date(if_else(after_injunction == 1, "2022-06-01", NA_character_)) # Define the event date
  )
3. Perform the Event Study
Set the event window (e.g., 12 months before and after the event) and compute the event study:

library(eventstudyr)

# Define the event window
event_window <- c(-12, 12) # 12 months before and after the event

# Perform event study
event_study_results <- compute_event_study(
  data = analysis_data,
  dependent_var = "death_rate", # Replace with your dependent variable
  time_var = "time",           # Time variable (date column)
  group_var = "state",         # Grouping variable (e.g., state)
  event_var = "event_date",    # Event date variable
  event_window = event_window,
  estimator = lm_estimator     # Use linear model for estimation
)
4. Visualize the Results
You can visualize the event study results to examine the impact of the event on death_rate:

# Plot the event study results
plot_event_study(event_study_results)
Full Example Code
library(dplyr)
library(eventstudyr)

# Prepare the data
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.Date(paste0(year_of_death, "-", month, "-01")), # Combine year and month
    event_date = as.Date(if_else(after_injunction == 1, "2022-06-01", NA_character_)) # Event date
  )

# Define event window
event_window <- c(-12, 12)

# Perform the event study
event_study_results <- compute_event_study(
  data = analysis_data,
  dependent_var = "death_rate", # Replace with your dependent variable
  time_var = "time",           # Time variable
  group_var = "state",         # Grouping variable
  event_var = "event_date",    # Event date variable
  event_window = event_window,
  estimator = lm_estimator     # Estimation method
)

# Plot the results
plot_event_study(event_study_results)
Key Points
time Column: Converts year and month into a proper date format (yyyy-mm-dd).
event_date: Sets a specific date for when the event occurs.
Event Window: Adjust the event_window to include your desired periods before and after the event.
Grouping Variable: Use an appropriate grouping variable, such as state or region.

Here’s how you can use the EventStudy function to perform an event study analysis tailored to your dataset:

1. Data Preparation
Ensure your data is in the correct format:

Outcome variable: The variable you're analyzing (e.g., death_rate).
Policy variable: A binary indicator for whether the policy (e.g., after_injunction) is in effect.
Identifier: A unique ID for units (e.g., state).
Time variable: A time index (combine year and month into a proper time format).
Example:

library(dplyr)

# Prepare the data
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.numeric(paste0(year_of_death, sprintf("%02d", month))), # Create a numeric time index
    policy = as.numeric(after_injunction == 1) # Convert after_injunction to a binary policy indicator
  )
2. Run the Event Study
Basic Example
This example estimates the effect of a policy over a 3-period post-event window with no anticipation effects.

library(eventstudyr)

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",                # Ordinary Least Squares
  data = analysis_data,             # Your dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",        # Outcome variable
  policyvar = "policy",             # Policy variable
  idvar = "state",                  # Identifier (e.g., state)
  timevar = "time",                 # Time index (numeric or integer)
  pre = 0,                          # No anticipation effects
  post = 3,                         # 3 periods post-event
  normalize = -1,                   # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                        # Include unit fixed-effects
  TFE = TRUE,                       # Include time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE                    # Clustered standard errors
)

# Summary of the model
summary(eventstudy_model$output)
Dynamic Example
Include anticipation effects, controls, and extend the event window.

eventstudy_model_dyn <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",
  data = analysis_data,
  outcomevar = "death_rate",
  policyvar = "policy",
  idvar = "state",
  timevar = "time",
  controls = c("year_of_death", "abortion_legality"), # Add relevant controls
  FE = TRUE,
  TFE = TRUE,
  post = 3,                   # 3 periods post-event
  overidpost = 5,             # Include additional periods for post-event estimation
  pre = 2,                    # 2 periods of anticipation
  overidpre = 4,              # Include additional pre-event periods
  normalize = -3,             # Normalize coefficients
  cluster = TRUE,             # Clustered standard errors
  anticipation_effects_normalization = TRUE # Adjust normalization for anticipation effects
)

# Summary of the dynamic model
summary(eventstudy_model_dyn$output)

# Coefficients
estimatr::tidy(eventstudy_model_dyn$output)
3. Model Interpretation
Coefficients: Represent the impact of the policy at various time periods relative to the event.
Fixed Effects: Controls for unobserved heterogeneity across units and time.
Clustered Standard Errors: Accounts for correlations within units over time.
4. Visualization
Visualize the dynamic effects over time:

# Visualize coefficients
plot(eventstudy_model_dyn$output)
Notes:
Adjust pre, post, and overidpost/pre based on the temporal structure of your study.
Add controls if other covariates might influence the outcome variable.
Use estimator = "FHS" for instrumental variable estimation (requires proxy and proxyIV).

timevar	
Character indicating column of time periods.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In the EventStudy function, the timevar parameter specifies the column representing time periods in your dataset. This column must uniquely identify each time period, either as numeric or as character strings that can be ordered chronologically.

Creating a Suitable timevar Column
Since you have year and month variables, you can combine them into a single timevar column. Below are two approaches:

1. Combine year and month into a Numeric Index
Create a numeric time index for each year and month:

library(dplyr)

# Combine year and month into a numeric index
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.numeric(paste0(year_of_death, sprintf("%02d", month))) # e.g., 202201 for Jan 2022
  )
This approach ensures chronological ordering (e.g., 202201, 202202, ..., 202312).
Use time as your timevar in the EventStudy function.
2. Combine year and month into a Date
If you prefer to work with actual dates, create a Date column:

# Combine year and month into a Date
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    time = as.Date(paste0(year_of_death, "-", month, "-01")) # e.g., "2022-01-01"
  )
The time column is now in Date format.
Use it as your timevar in EventStudy. The function will handle it as an ordered time variable.
Example Usage in EventStudy
Once you've created the time column, specify it as timevar:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",
  data = analysis_data,
  outcomevar = "death_rate",
  policyvar = "policy",
  idvar = "state",
  timevar = "time",           # Use the prepared time column
  pre = 2,                    # Pre-event periods
  post = 3,                   # Post-event periods
  normalize = -1,             # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                  # Fixed effects
  TFE = TRUE,                 # Time fixed effects
  cluster = TRUE              # Clustered standard errors
)

# Summary of results
summary(eventstudy_model$output)
Key Points
Numeric timevar: Suitable for sequential analysis (e.g., 202201, 202202).
Date timevar: Provides more interpretability for real-world timelines.
Sorting: Ensure the timevar column is properly ordered for chronological analysis.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates issues with your dataset, specifically related to its structure and how the EventStudy function processes the panel data. Let’s address the warnings and error step by step.

1. Warnings: Unbalanced Dataset
An "unbalanced" dataset means some idvar (e.g., states) do not have data for all timevar periods. This is common in panel data and not necessarily problematic. However, gaps in timevar can cause issues, as EventStudy assumes continuous time.

Solution: Fill Missing Time Periods
You can fill in missing combinations of idvar and timevar with NA to make the dataset balanced. Use tidyr::complete:

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Ensure `time` and `state` columns are properly defined
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(time = as.numeric(paste0(year_of_death, sprintf("%02d", month)))) # Ensure numeric `time`

# Create a complete dataset with all combinations of `state` and `time`
complete_data <- analysis_data %>%
  complete(state, time = seq(min(time), max(time)), fill = list(death_rate = NA))
2. Warning: Gaps in timevar
The warning about "gaps of more than one unit in the time variable" suggests irregular time intervals. EventStudy treats these as missing periods, which can result in incorrect inferences.

Solution: Verify Gaps in timevar
Check for missing time periods within each idvar:

# Check for gaps in time
analysis_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(
    gaps = any(diff(sort(unique(time))) > 1) # Detect gaps > 1
  )
If gaps exist, ensure time is sequential for all idvar. This could mean interpolating or imputing data, depending on the analysis:

# Example: Interpolate missing death_rate values
complete_data <- complete_data %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  arrange(time) %>%
  mutate(death_rate = zoo::na.approx(death_rate, na.rm = FALSE)) # Linear interpolation
3. Error: Duplicate Keys
The error suggests there are duplicate combinations of idvar and timevar in your dataset. EventStudy expects unique combinations of idvar and timevar.

Solution: Check for Duplicates
Identify and resolve duplicates in your dataset:

# Check for duplicate rows
duplicates <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(state, time) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

print(duplicates) # Inspect duplicate rows

# Remove duplicates (if they exist)
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  distinct(state, time, .keep_all = TRUE)
4. Rerun the EventStudy Model
After addressing these issues, retry running your EventStudy model with the cleaned dataset:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",
  data = complete_data,           # Use cleaned, balanced dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",
  policyvar = "policy",
  idvar = "state",
  timevar = "time",
  pre = 2,                        # Pre-event periods
  post = 3,                       # Post-event periods
  normalize = -1,                 # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                      # Fixed effects
  TFE = TRUE,                     # Time fixed effects
  cluster = TRUE                  # Clustered standard errors
)

# Summary of results
summary(eventstudy_model$output)
Additional Notes:
Handling Missing Data:

If you cannot interpolate, consider using na.omit() to drop rows with missing values. However, this may lead to a loss of data.
Allow Cartesian Joins (If Necessary): If the error persists despite cleaning, add allow.cartesian = TRUE when merging or completing datasets. This is not ideal but may resolve the issue temporarily.

Double-Check Input Parameters: Ensure all input variables (outcomevar, policyvar, idvar, timevar) are correctly named and formatted.

Error in EventStudy(estimator = "OLS", data = analysis_data, outcomevar = "death_rate",  : 
  unused argument (allow.cartesian = TRUE)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the allow.cartesian argument is not a recognized parameter of the EventStudy function in the eventstudyr package. This argument is typically used in data.table joins and cannot be directly applied here.

To address this issue, you need to resolve the underlying data structure issues (e.g., duplicates or unbalanced data) directly in your dataset. Here's how you can proceed:

1. Remove allow.cartesian
Remove allow.cartesian = TRUE from the EventStudy call, as it is not valid for this function.

2. Verify Input Variables
Ensure that the following variables are correctly formatted:

outcomevar (death_rate): Must be numeric.
policyvar (after_injunction): Must be numeric or binary (0/1).
idvar (abortion_illegal): Must uniquely identify units (e.g., states or groups).
timevar (time): Must be numeric or an integer representing time periods.
Check the structure of the dataset:

str(analysis_data)
3. Handle Duplicates in idvar and timevar
Ensure there are no duplicate rows for any combination of idvar and timevar. Use the following code to identify and resolve duplicates:

# Check for duplicates
duplicates <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(abortion_illegal, time) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

print(duplicates) # View duplicates

# Remove duplicates
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  distinct(abortion_illegal, time, .keep_all = TRUE)
4. Balance the Dataset
Fill missing combinations of idvar and timevar to balance the panel:

library(tidyr)

# Fill missing combinations of idvar and timevar
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  complete(
    abortion_illegal,
    time = seq(min(time), max(time), by = 1), # Ensure continuous time
    fill = list(death_rate = NA)             # Fill missing outcome with NA
  )
5. Rerun the EventStudy Model
After cleaning the dataset, rerun the EventStudy function without allow.cartesian:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",                # Ordinary Least Squares
  data = analysis_data,             # Your cleaned dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",        # Outcome variable
  policyvar = "after_injunction",   # Policy variable
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",       # Identifier (e.g., state)
  timevar = "time",                 # Time index (numeric or integer)
  pre = 0,                          # No anticipation effects
  post = 3,                         # 3 periods post-event
  normalize = -1,                   # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                        # Include unit fixed-effects
  TFE = TRUE,                       # Include time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE                    # Clustered standard errors
)
6. Summary and Diagnostics
Inspect the model output:

# Model summary
summary(eventstudy_model$output)

# View estimated coefficients
estimatr::tidy(eventstudy_model$output)
Key Adjustments:
Remove the allow.cartesian argument from the EventStudy function.
Ensure no duplicate rows exist for any combination of idvar and timevar.
Balance the dataset by filling missing combinations of idvar and timevar.
Let me know if further issues arise!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that there are gaps in your timevar (the time column) and that the EventStudy function expects it to be numeric or integer, with sequential and continuous time periods for each idvar. The error also suggests that the column provided to timevar is not being treated as numeric.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
1. Ensure timevar is Numeric
Ensure that the time column provided to timevar is numeric or integer. You can check the column type and convert it if necessary:

# Check column type
str(analysis_data$time)

# Convert to numeric if necessary
analysis_data$time <- as.numeric(analysis_data$time)
2. Address Gaps in timevar
The warning about gaps in timevar suggests there are missing time periods in your panel. You need to fill all time periods for each idvar to create a balanced panel.

library(tidyr)

# Fill missing time periods for each idvar
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  complete(
    abortion_illegal,                # idvar
    time = seq(min(time), max(time), by = 1), # Ensure continuous time
    fill = list(death_rate = NA)     # Fill missing outcome with NA
  )
3. Check for Non-Numeric Columns
The error non-numeric argument to binary operator suggests that a variable in your dataset, likely policyvar or outcomevar, is not numeric.

Ensure that after_injunction is numeric (binary 0/1):
# Convert to numeric if necessary
analysis_data$after_injunction <- as.numeric(analysis_data$after_injunction)
Ensure that death_rate is numeric:
# Convert to numeric if necessary
analysis_data$death_rate <- as.numeric(analysis_data$death_rate)
4. Rerun the EventStudy Model
After cleaning and verifying the dataset, try running the model again:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",                # Ordinary Least Squares
  data = analysis_data,             # Your cleaned dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",        # Outcome variable
  policyvar = "after_injunction",   # Policy variable
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",       # Identifier (e.g., state)
  timevar = "time",                 # Time index (numeric or integer)
  pre = 0,                          # No anticipation effects
  post = 3,                         # 3 periods post-event
  normalize = -1,                   # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                        # Include unit fixed-effects
  TFE = TRUE,                       # Include time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE                    # Clustered standard errors
)
5. Verify the Data
If the error persists, manually inspect the dataset to identify potential issues:

# Check for missing or non-numeric values
summary(analysis_data)

# Check for duplicates
duplicates <- analysis_data %>%
  group_by(abortion_illegal, time) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

print(duplicates)

# Check for gaps in time periods for each idvar
analysis_data %>%
  group_by(abortion_illegal) %>%
  summarize(
    time_gaps = any(diff(sort(unique(time))) > 1)
  )
Common Issues and Solutions
Non-Numeric Columns:

Ensure outcomevar (death_rate), policyvar (after_injunction), and timevar (time) are numeric.
Missing Time Periods:

Use tidyr::complete() to fill missing time periods for a balanced panel.
Non-Unique Combinations of idvar and timevar:

Remove duplicate rows with distinct().

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error and warning suggest issues with the month_code variable and potentially with other columns such as policy. Here's a step-by-step solution to resolve these issues:

1. Ensure month_code is Numeric
The timevar column (month_code in your case) must be numeric. Verify and, if necessary, convert it:

# Check and convert `month_code` to numeric
str(analysis_data_event$month_code)

analysis_data_event$month_code <- as.numeric(analysis_data_event$month_code)
2. Handle Gaps in month_code
The warning indicates there are gaps in the month_code sequence. This might be due to missing months in your panel data. To address this, create a balanced panel with all combinations of idvar and month_code:

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)

# Fill missing combinations of `abortion_illegal` (idvar) and `month_code` (timevar)
analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  complete(
    abortion_illegal,                       # Identifier variable
    month_code = seq(min(month_code), max(month_code), by = 1), # Continuous time sequence
    fill = list(death_rate = NA, policy = 0) # Fill missing values
  )
3. Ensure policy is Numeric
The policyvar column (policy in your case) must also be numeric or binary (0/1). Verify and convert if necessary:

# Check and convert `policy` to numeric
str(analysis_data_event$policy)

analysis_data_event$policy <- as.numeric(analysis_data_event$policy)
4. Verify death_rate is Numeric
Similarly, ensure the outcome variable (death_rate) is numeric:

# Check and convert `death_rate` to numeric
str(analysis_data_event$death_rate)

analysis_data_event$death_rate <- as.numeric(analysis_data_event$death_rate)
5. Check for Duplicates
Ensure there are no duplicate rows for combinations of idvar and timevar:

# Identify duplicates
duplicates <- analysis_data_event %>%
  group_by(abortion_illegal, month_code) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

print(duplicates)

# Remove duplicates
analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  distinct(abortion_illegal, month_code, .keep_all = TRUE)
6. Rerun the Event Study
Now that the dataset has been cleaned, rerun the EventStudy model:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",                # Ordinary Least Squares
  data = analysis_data_event,       # Cleaned dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",        # Outcome variable
  policyvar = "policy",             # Policy variable
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",       # Identifier
  timevar = "month_code",           # Time index
  pre = 0,                          # No anticipation effects
  post = 3,                         # 3 periods post-event
  normalize = -1,                   # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                        # Include unit fixed-effects
  TFE = TRUE,                       # Include time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE                    # Clustered standard errors
)
7. Verify Model Output
Once the model runs, examine the results:

# Summary of the model
summary(eventstudy_model$output)

# View coefficients
estimatr::tidy(eventstudy_model$output)
Checklist Summary
Ensure Numeric Columns:

month_code (timevar), policy (policyvar), and death_rate (outcomevar) should be numeric.
Handle Missing Time Periods:

Use tidyr::complete() to create a balanced panel.
Remove Duplicates:

Ensure no duplicate rows for combinations of idvar and timevar.

The error indicates issues with duplicates and gaps in the month_code column (time variable) or mismatches between the idvar (abortion_illegal) and timevar (month_code). Here's a systematic way to resolve these problems:

1. Check for Duplicates
Ensure there are no duplicate rows in your dataset for the combination of idvar (abortion_illegal) and timevar (month_code):

# Check for duplicates
duplicates <- analysis_data_event %>%
  group_by(abortion_illegal, month_code) %>%
  filter(n() > 1)

print(duplicates)

# Remove duplicates
analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  distinct(abortion_illegal, month_code, .keep_all = TRUE)
2. Handle Gaps in month_code
The warning about gaps suggests missing time periods in the panel. Fill missing combinations of abortion_illegal and month_code to balance the dataset:

library(tidyr)

# Fill missing time periods
analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  complete(
    abortion_illegal,                       # Identifier
    month_code = seq(min(month_code), max(month_code), by = 1), # Continuous time sequence
    fill = list(death_rate = NA, after_injunction = 0)          # Fill missing values
  )
This ensures all combinations of abortion_illegal and month_code exist, even if some values are missing (NA).

3. Ensure month_code is Numeric
Confirm that month_code is numeric:

analysis_data_event$month_code <- as.numeric(analysis_data_event$month_code)
4. Ensure policy and after_injunction are Numeric
The policyvar (after_injunction) must be numeric (e.g., 0/1). Ensure it is properly formatted:

analysis_data_event$after_injunction <- as.numeric(analysis_data_event$after_injunction)
5. Check policy Column
Your code creates policy as "illegal" or "legal", but this does not align with the policyvar (after_injunction), which must be numeric. If policy is not used in the EventStudy function, you can remove or clarify its purpose.

6. Rerun the Event Study
After cleaning the dataset, rerun the EventStudy function:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",                # Ordinary Least Squares
  data = analysis_data_event,       # Cleaned dataset
  outcomevar = "death_rate",        # Outcome variable
  policyvar = "after_injunction",   # Policy variable
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",       # Identifier
  timevar = "month_code",           # Time index
  pre = 0,                          # No anticipation effects
  post = 3,                         # 3 periods post-event
  normalize = -1,                   # Normalize coefficients
  FE = TRUE,                        # Include unit fixed-effects
  TFE = TRUE,                       # Include time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE                    # Clustered standard errors
)
7. Debugging Tips
If the error persists:

Inspect Dataset: Check the structure of analysis_data_event:

str(analysis_data_event)
summary(analysis_data_event)
Check for Large Joins: The error suggests excessive row duplication in a join. Manually inspect the size of the dataset before and after cleaning:

nrow(analysis_data_event)
Simplify the Dataset: If the dataset is too complex, focus on a subset for testing (e.g., specific states or months):

analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  filter(abortion_illegal %in% c(1, 0))

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The message indicates that some coefficients are NA because the design matrix is rank deficient, meaning it has linearly dependent columns or insufficient variation in the data for certain variables. Here’s how you can address this issue:

1. Understand the Problem
Rank deficiency typically occurs due to:

Perfect multicollinearity: Some predictors can be expressed as a linear combination of others.
Lack of variation in the data: For example, if a predictor (e.g., after_injunction) has the same value across certain time periods or units, it cannot estimate effects for those variables.
Missing data: If some variables or combinations of variables have many NAs, the corresponding coefficients cannot be estimated.
2. Check the Data
Inspect your data for issues related to rank deficiency:

Check for Multicollinearity:
library(car)
vif(eventstudy_model$output) # Check Variance Inflation Factors
If VIF values are high (e.g., > 10), this indicates multicollinearity among predictors.
Check for Variation in Variables:
Inspect the variation in your key variables:

table(analysis_data_event$after_injunction)
table(analysis_data_event$month_code)
table(analysis_data_event$abortion_illegal)
If any variable has constant or near-constant values, it cannot be used to estimate coefficients.

Check for Missing Data:
Inspect for missing values in the problematic variables:

colSums(is.na(analysis_data_event))
3. Address Rank Deficiency
Depending on the issue, here are solutions:

3.1 Drop Linearly Dependent Predictors
If the model includes perfectly collinear predictors, remove redundant variables:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",
  data = analysis_data_event,
  outcomevar = "death_rate",
  policyvar = "after_injunction",
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",
  timevar = "month_code",
  pre = 0,
  post = 3,
  normalize = -1,
  FE = TRUE,
  TFE = FALSE, # Exclude time fixed-effects if they are collinear with policyvar
  cluster = TRUE
)
3.2 Increase Data Variation
If the issue is lack of variation:

Expand the dataset to include more years or months (if possible).
Balance the panel using tidyr::complete():
library(tidyr)

analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  complete(
    abortion_illegal,
    month_code = seq(min(month_code), max(month_code), by = 1),
    fill = list(death_rate = NA, after_injunction = 0)
  )
3.3 Address Missing Data
If missing data is the issue, handle it before modeling:

Remove rows with missing values for key variables:
analysis_data_event <- analysis_data_event %>%
  filter(!is.na(after_injunction), !is.na(death_rate))
Impute missing values (if appropriate):
library(mice)
analysis_data_event <- mice(analysis_data_event, m = 1) %>% complete()
3.4 Test Simplified Models
Run a simplified model to diagnose the issue. For example, exclude interaction terms or fixed-effects:

eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",
  data = analysis_data_event,
  outcomevar = "death_rate",
  policyvar = "after_injunction",
  idvar = "abortion_illegal",
  timevar = "month_code",
  pre = 0,
  post = 3,
  normalize = -1,
  FE = FALSE,  # Exclude unit fixed-effects
  TFE = FALSE, # Exclude time fixed-effects
  cluster = TRUE
)
4. Diagnostics
After rerunning the model, check for remaining issues:

Inspect Coefficients:
summary(eventstudy_model$output)
Visualize Missing Coefficients:
Identify which coefficients remain undefined:

library(ggplot2)
estimatr::tidy(eventstudy_model$output) %>%
  ggplot(aes(term, estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal()
5. Iterative Debugging
If coefficients are still NA:

Examine the specific variables with undefined coefficients.
Test simpler subsets of predictors and build back complexity incrementally.

Error in UseMethod("tidy") : 
  no applicable method for 'tidy' applied to an object of class "NULL"
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that EventStudyPlot is attempting to apply the tidy method to an object that is NULL, which implies that the output of your eventstudy_model does not contain the expected coefficients or data for plotting. Here are steps to resolve this issue:

1. Check the Model Output
Inspect the contents of your eventstudy_model to ensure it contains the expected data:

str(eventstudy_model$output)
If eventstudy_model$output is NULL, it indicates that the event study model did not produce results, likely due to an issue with the input data or the design matrix.

2. Verify the Model Fitting
Run summary() on your model to ensure it has successfully fitted:

summary(eventstudy_model$output)
If the summary does not show coefficients, the issue lies in the model setup or input data.

3. Revisit the Input Data
Check for potential issues in your dataset, such as missing data, non-numeric values, or gaps in the panel structure:

Ensure Key Variables Are Correctly Defined:
outcomevar (death_rate) is numeric.
policyvar (after_injunction) is binary (0/1).
idvar (abortion_illegal) uniquely identifies groups.
timevar (month_code) is numeric and sequential.
4. Attempt Manual Plotting
If EventStudyPlot does not work directly, you can extract the coefficients and plot them manually:

Extract Coefficients:
Use the estimatr::tidy() function to extract coefficients from the model output:

library(estimatr)

model_coefficients <- estimatr::tidy(eventstudy_model$output)

# Inspect coefficients
print(model_coefficients)
Plot Coefficients:
Use ggplot2 to create the plot manually:

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(model_coefficients, aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high), width = 0.2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(x = "Event time", y = "Coefficient") +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_flip()
5. Debugging Tips
If the eventstudy_model$output is NULL, revisit the model:

Simplify the Model: Remove fixed effects (FE and TFE) or interactions to diagnose issues.

Test Subsets of Data: Use a smaller or filtered subset of analysis_data_event for testing.

subset_data <- analysis_data_event %>%
  filter(abortion_illegal %in% c(0, 1), month_code >= 202201)

# Run the simplified model on the subset
eventstudy_model <- EventStudy(
  estimator = "OLS",

placebo test in r for did
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
A placebo test in a Difference-in-Differences (DID) framework is used to check for pre-treatment trends or other anomalies in the data. Here’s how you can perform a placebo test in R:

1. Overview
The idea is to:

Simulate a placebo treatment at a time before the actual treatment.
Re-run the DID analysis with this "fake" treatment.
Check if the coefficient for the placebo treatment is statistically significant. If it is, this suggests pre-treatment differences that could invalidate the DID assumptions.
2. Steps to Perform a Placebo Test
2.1 Simulate Placebo Treatment
Create a placebo treatment variable that assumes treatment starts at a time before the actual treatment.

library(dplyr)

# Create placebo treatment (e.g., pretend treatment starts one year earlier)
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    placebo_treatment = if_else(year_of_death < actual_treatment_year, 1, 0)
  )
2.2 Fit the DID Model with Placebo Treatment
Run the DID regression with the placebo treatment:

library(fixest)

# Fit the DID model with placebo treatment
placebo_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ placebo_treatment * post_treatment | state + year_of_death, # Fixed effects for state and year
  data = analysis_data
)

# Summarize the model
summary(placebo_model)
Here:

placebo_treatment * post_treatment captures the interaction term for the placebo DID.
Fixed effects (state + year_of_death) control for unit- and time-specific effects.
2.3 Interpret the Results
Key Coefficient: Look at the interaction term (placebo_treatment:post_treatment).
If it is statistically significant, this suggests a violation of the parallel trends assumption.
If it is not significant, the parallel trends assumption is more likely valid.
3. Alternative Approach: Event Study with Placebo Treatment
An event study approach can visually check for pre-treatment trends, including placebo treatments:

# Create event time variable for placebo treatment
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    event_time = year_of_death - actual_treatment_year - 1 # Subtract 1 year for placebo
  )

# Fit the event study model
event_study_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ i(event_time, ref = -1) | state + year_of_death, # ref = -1 normalizes to the year before placebo
  data = analysis_data
)

# Plot coefficients
iplot(event_study_model)
In the plot:

Pre-treatment coefficients (before placebo treatment) should be close to zero if the parallel trends assumption holds.
4. Diagnostics
4.1 Check for Parallel Trends
Use the original treatment variable and include pre-treatment leads to formally test for parallel trends:

# Test parallel trends with leads
parallel_trends_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ i(post_treatment, ref = -1) | state + year_of_death,
  data = analysis_data
)

summary(parallel_trends_model)
iplot(parallel_trends_model)
4.2 Use Robust Standard Errors
Ensure clustered standard errors at the state level:

placebo_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ placebo_treatment * post_treatment | state + year_of_death,
  cluster = ~state, # Clustered errors by state
  data = analysis_data
)

summary(placebo_model)
5. Full Workflow Example
Here’s a streamlined implementation:

library(dplyr)
library(fixest)

# Create placebo treatment
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    placebo_treatment = if_else(year_of_death < actual_treatment_year, 1, 0)
  )

# Fit DID model with placebo treatment
placebo_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ placebo_treatment * post_treatment | state + year_of_death,
  cluster = ~state, # Cluster standard errors by state
  data = analysis_data
)

# Summarize the model
summary(placebo_model)

# Event study visualization
event_study_model <- feols(
  death_rate ~ i(event_time, ref = -1) | state + year_of_death,
  data = analysis_data
)

iplot(event_study_model)

I want to mutate a unique person id 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a unique identifier for each person in your dataset, you can use the mutate function along with row_number or group_indices from the dplyr package, depending on the structure of your dataset.

1. If You Want a Simple Unique ID
Use row_number() to assign a unique identifier for each row:

library(dplyr)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = row_number())
This assigns a sequential unique ID to each row in the dataset.

2. If You Want a Unique ID by Group
If your dataset contains groups (e.g., by state, year, etc.) and you want a unique ID for each person within or across those groups, use group_indices or row_number grouped by certain variables:

data <- data %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%  # Replace with your grouping variables
  mutate(person_id = row_number()) %>%  # Unique ID within groups
  ungroup()
Alternatively, for unique IDs across all rows but accounting for grouping variables:

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = group_indices(state, year)) # Unique ID across groups
3. If You Need a Hash-Based ID
If you want a hashed unique identifier based on certain variables (e.g., name, birthdate, state), use the digest package:

library(dplyr)
library(digest)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = sapply(paste(name, birthdate, state, sep = "_"), digest))
This creates a hashed unique ID based on the concatenated values of the selected columns.

Example Dataset
Assume your dataset looks like this:

name	birthdate	state	year
Alice	1990-01-01	California	2022
Bob	1985-05-15	Texas	2022
Alice	1990-01-01	California	2023
Adding Unique IDs
library(dplyr)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = row_number())  # Simple sequential ID
Adding Group-Specific Unique IDs
data <- data %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  mutate(person_id = row_number()) %>%
  ungroup()
Adding Hash-Based Unique IDs
library(digest)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = sapply(paste(name, birthdate, state, sep = "_"), digest))
Let me know how you'd like your unique ID structured!







You said:
I want person's number be discrete
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want each person in your dataset to have a discrete, unique, integer-based identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3,...), you can achieve this by combining relevant identifying columns (e.g., name, birthdate, etc.) and then generating a unique integer ID for each combination.

Steps to Generate Discrete Unique Person IDs
1. Using group_indices
This method assigns a unique integer ID to each unique combination of variables that define a person.

library(dplyr)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = group_indices(name, birthdate, state))
This creates a unique person_id for each distinct combination of name, birthdate, and state.
The IDs will be discrete integers starting from 1.
2. Using dense_rank
If you need IDs based on a specific order, you can use dense_rank.

data <- data %>%
  arrange(name, birthdate, state) %>%
  mutate(person_id = dense_rank(paste(name, birthdate, state)))
3. If You Have Missing Identifiers
If you only have partial information (e.g., some columns have missing values), ensure you handle NA properly. You can replace missing values with placeholders or exclude them when generating IDs:

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    name = replace_na(name, "Unknown"),
    birthdate = replace_na(birthdate, "1900-01-01"),
    person_id = group_indices(name, birthdate, state)
  )
Example
Input Data
name	birthdate	state
Alice	1990-01-01	California
Bob	1985-05-15	Texas
Alice	1990-01-01	California
Carol	1992-08-20	New York
Code
library(dplyr)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(person_id = group_indices(name, birthdate, state))
Output
name	birthdate	state	person_id
Alice	1990-01-01	California	1
Bob	1985-05-15	Texas	2
Alice	1990-01-01	California	1
Carol	1992-08-20	New York	3

use year and month to create date
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a date column using the year and month columns in R, you can use the as.Date() function after combining the values into a valid date string. Here's how you can do it:

1. Using mutate to Combine Year and Month
If you want the date to default to the first day of each month:

library(dplyr)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, month, "01", sep = "-")))
This will generate a date column in the format YYYY-MM-DD, where the day is set to the first day of the month.

2. Handling Numeric and Character Months
If the month column is numeric and needs to be formatted as two digits (e.g., 1 → 01), you can use sprintf():

data <- data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, sprintf("%02d", month), "01", sep = "-")))
3. Example
Input Data:
year	month
2022	1
2022	12
2023	5
Code:
library(dplyr)

data <- data.frame(
  year = c(2022, 2022, 2023),
  month = c(1, 12, 5)
)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(paste(year, sprintf("%02d", month), "01", sep = "-")))

print(data)
Output:
year	month	date
2022	1	2022-01-01
2022	12	2022-12-01
2023	5	2023-05-01
4. Advanced: Use Specific Day
If you want a different day (e.g., the last day of the month), use the lubridate package:

library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)

data <- data %>%
  mutate(date = make_date(year, month) + months(1) - days(1)) # Last day of the month

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add a vertical line at June 2022 (2022.6) to your ggplot, you can use geom_vline() and specify the date as as.Date("2022-06-01"). Here’s the updated code:

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(analysis_data, aes(y = death_rate, x = date, color = abortion_illegal)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2022-06-01"), linetype = "dashed", color = "red", size = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Date of Infant Death",
    y = "Death Rate",
    color = "Abortion is Illegal Or Not",
    caption = "Data source: CDC Wonder."
  )
Explanation:
geom_vline():

xintercept = as.Date("2022-06-01"): Specifies the date for the vertical line.
linetype = "dashed": Makes the line dashed for better visibility.
color = "red": Sets the color of the line to red.
size = 1: Adjusts the line thickness.
Date Format:

Ensure your date column in analysis_data is of type Date to match the format of xintercept.
Sample Output:
The plot will include:

Points and a smooth line for death_rate over time, colored by whether abortion is illegal or not.
A red dashed vertical line at June 2022 to highlight the specified date.

build a map, use abortion_illgeal as color for each state
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a map visualizing whether abortion is illegal in each state, you can use the ggplot2 package along with a map of U.S. states from the maps or sf package. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Prepare the Data
Ensure your dataset includes:

A column for state names (state).
A column indicating whether abortion is illegal (abortion_illegal).
2. Load U.S. Map Data
Use the maps package to get a map of U.S. states:

library(ggplot2)
library(maps)
library(dplyr)

# Load U.S. state map data
us_states <- map_data("state")

# Example dataset: state and abortion status
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California")),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)

# Merge map data with abortion status
map_data <- us_states %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = c("region" = "state"))
3. Create the Map
Plot the map using ggplot2:

ggplot(map_data, aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = abortion_illegal)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),  # Customize colors
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Clean, map-specific theme
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Status by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Explanation
map_data("state"):

Loads the U.S. map data with coordinates for each state.
Merge with Data:

Join your abortion_status dataset with the map data using left_join.
geom_polygon():

Draws the state boundaries on the map.
fill = abortion_illegal colors each state based on abortion status.
Custom Color Scale:

scale_fill_manual assigns specific colors to 0 (legal) and 1 (illegal).
theme_void():

Removes axis labels and gridlines for a clean map.
Example Output
Red States: Where abortion is illegal.
Blue States: Where abortion is legal.

if I have only state name, no lat and long, I want to fill the map
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you only have state names and their associated values (e.g., abortion_illegal), you can use the us_map data from the usmap package or an equivalent shapefile (from sf) to create a choropleth map.

Here’s how to create a filled map:

1. Install and Load Required Packages
Install the usmap and ggplot2 packages:

install.packages("usmap")
install.packages("ggplot2")
Load the required libraries:

library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
2. Prepare Your Data
Your dataset should look like this:

abortion_status <- data.frame(
  state = c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California"),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)
Ensure the state names match the format expected by usmap (e.g., title case). If they don’t, use tolower() or toupper() to standardize.

3. Join Data with State Map
Use the usmap::plot_usmap() function to fill the map:

# Merge map with data using the built-in state mapping
plot_data <- usmap::us_map() %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = c("full" = "state"))
4. Plot the Map
Create a choropleth map:

ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),  # Custom colors
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axes and gridlines
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Status by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Key Steps Explained
usmap::us_map():

Provides a pre-built map of U.S. states with lat/long coordinates.
left_join():

Joins your abortion_status data with the map data based on state names.
geom_polygon():

Draws the polygons (state boundaries) on the map.
fill = abortion_illegal colors each state based on its abortion status.
Custom Colors:

scale_fill_manual lets you specify custom colors for each status.
Expected Output
Red States: Abortion is illegal (abortion_illegal = 1).
Blue States: Abortion is legal (abortion_illegal = 0).

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a graph of U.S. states where abortion is illegal, you can use the usmap package or other shapefile libraries like sf. Here’s how you can plot a map highlighting states where abortion is illegal:

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install Required Packages
Install the necessary packages if you don’t already have them:

install.packages("usmap")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
2. Load Required Libraries
Load the required libraries:

library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
3. Prepare Your Data
Create a dataset listing states and their abortion legality status:

abortion_status <- data.frame(
  state = c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", 
            "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia"),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)
Ensure the state names match the format expected by usmap.

4. Merge Data with US Map
Use usmap to merge the map data with your abortion legality data:

# Merge map data with abortion status
map_data <- usmap::us_map() %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = c("full" = "state"))
5. Plot the Map
Use ggplot2 to plot the map and highlight states based on their abortion legality:

ggplot(map_data, aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),  # Custom colors: blue = legal, red = illegal
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Remove axes and gridlines
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Output
Red States: Where abortion is illegal (abortion_illegal = 1).
Blue States: Where abortion is legal (abortion_illegal = 0).
Optional: Highlight Only Illegal States
If you only want to show states where abortion is illegal, filter the data:

illegal_states <- map_data %>%
  filter(abortion_illegal == 1)

ggplot(illegal_states, aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("1" = "red"), labels = c("Illegal"), name = "Abortion Status") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "States Where Abortion is Illegal",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
This approach highlights only the states where abortion is illegal. Let me know if you'd like additional customization!

The error arises because the number of rows for state and abortion_illegal does not match. You have listed 50 states in the state column, but only 48 values for abortion_illegal. This mismatch causes the error.

Here’s the corrected code:

Corrected Data Preparation
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Ensure the number of states and `abortion_illegal` values match
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(c(

    1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
  ) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)
Plotting the Map
Now, merge the data with the US map data and plot the map:

# Load US map data
us_map_data <- us_map()

# Merge abortion legality status with map data
map_data <- us_map_data %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = c("full" = "state"))

# Plot the map
ggplot(map_data, aes(x = x, y = y, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),  # Red for illegal, blue for legal
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Clean map theme
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Explanation
Fixed Data Issue:

The mismatch in the number of rows between state and abortion_illegal caused the error. The corrected abortion_status now has 50 rows.
Merged Data:

The us_map_data includes state boundaries. The left_join ensures each state's abortion legality status is correctly linked.
Plotting:

The geom_polygon layer draws the state boundaries.
scale_fill_manual maps abortion_illegal values to colors (red for illegal, blue for legal).
Expected Output
A U.S. map where:
States where abortion is illegal are highlighted in red.
States where abortion is legal are highlighted in blue.

The error suggests that the x and y aesthetics required for geom_polygon() are not properly specified in the data. This might happen because the us_map() function generates data with column names long and lat for coordinates, not x and y.

Here’s how to correct the issue:

Correct Code
Ensure you are using the correct column names (long, lat, group) for the map data. Update the code as follows:

library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Prepare abortion legality data
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(c(
    "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", 
    "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana",

    "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
  )),
  abortion_illegal = c(
    1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 
    0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
    1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0
  ) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)

# Get US map data
us_map_data <- us_map()

# Merge map data with abortion status
map_data <- us_map_data %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = c("full" = "state"))

# Plot the map
ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),  # Red for illegal, blue for legal
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Clean map theme
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Key Changes
Corrected Column Names:

us_map() provides longitude and latitude columns named long and lat, not x and y. The aesthetics in geom_polygon() are updated to aes(x = long, y = lat).
Merged Data:

The left_join ensures the abortion_illegal status is added to the us_map_data correctly.
Visualization:

geom_polygon() draws the state boundaries.
scale_fill_manual() maps abortion_illegal to colors (red for illegal and blue for legal).
Expected Output
A U.S. map where:
States with abortion illegal (abortion_illegal = 1) are red.
States with abortion legal (abortion_illegal = 0) are blue.

The dataset you've shown includes state names (full), abbreviations (abbr), and the column abortion_illegal (indicating whether abortion is illegal) alongside geographic data (geom). You can use the sf package to plot this data on a map.

Here’s how you can visualize the states and their abortion legality status:

1. Load Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:

install.packages("sf")
install.packages("ggplot2")
Then load the libraries:

library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
2. Prepare the Data
Assuming your dataset is an sf object (based on the MULTIPOLYGON geometry in the geom column), you can directly proceed with the plotting.

If it’s not already an sf object, convert it:

# Assuming `state_data` is your dataset
state_data <- st_as_sf(state_data)
3. Plot the Map
Use ggplot2 to visualize the map with states colored by abortion_illegal:

ggplot(data = state_data) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal)), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Data source: Example Data"
  )
4. Explanation
geom_sf():

Used to plot the spatial data (sf object).
The fill aesthetic maps the abortion_illegal column to colors.
scale_fill_manual():

Maps 0 to blue (legal) and 1 to red (illegal).
Theme and Labels:

A clean minimal theme is used with a title and caption.
Expected Output
The map will:

Display U.S. states.
Color states where abortion is illegal in red and states where it is legal in blue.

map_data(map = "USA")
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To use map_data() from the ggplot2 package to plot a map of the USA, you need the maps package for geographic data. Here’s how you can use map_data() to create a map:

Step 1: Install Required Packages
Ensure the maps and ggplot2 packages are installed and loaded:

install.packages("maps")
install.packages("ggplot2")

library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
Step 2: Load USA Map Data
You can use the map_data() function to get map data for the USA:

us_map <- map_data("state")
This creates a data frame with latitude (lat), longitude (long), and other information such as region (state names) and group (for polygons).

Step 3: Merge with Your Data
If you have additional data, such as whether abortion is illegal in each state, merge it with the map data. For example:

# Sample data for abortion legality
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  region = tolower(c("alabama", "alaska", "arizona", "arkansas", "california", 
                     "colorado", "connecticut", "delaware", "florida", "georgia")),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)

# Merge map data with abortion status
us_map <- us_map %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = "region")
Step 4: Plot the Map
Now you can use ggplot2 to create a map of the USA, coloring the states by the abortion_illegal column:

ggplot(us_map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() + # Removes axis and grid lines
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Explanation
map_data("state"):

Retrieves map data for U.S. states.
Merge with Additional Data:

The left_join ensures each state has its corresponding abortion status.
geom_polygon():

Draws the state boundaries and fills them based on abortion_illegal.
Colors:

scale_fill_manual() maps 0 to blue (legal) and 1 to red (illegal).
Expected Output
A map of the USA where:
States where abortion is illegal are red.
States where abortion is legal are blue.

ℹ Error occurred in the 1st layer.
Caused by error:
! object 'group' not found
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that the group variable required for geom_polygon() is missing from your map data. The group variable is essential to draw polygons properly. Here’s how you can resolve this issue step by step:

Solution
Use map_data() correctly to obtain the group variable along with other geographic information.

Step 1: Load USA Map Data
Ensure the maps package is installed and then load the USA map data with map_data():

library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Load the map data for U.S. states
us_map <- map_data("state")
The us_map data frame contains:

long: Longitude.
lat: Latitude.
group: Identifier for groups of polygons.
region: State names in lowercase.
Step 2: Prepare Data
Merge your abortion_illegal data with the us_map data:

# Sample data for abortion legality
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  region = tolower(c("alabama", "alaska", "arizona", "arkansas", "california", 
                     "colorado", "connecticut", "delaware", "florida", "georgia")),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)

# Merge abortion status with map data
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = "region")
Step 3: Plot the Map
Create a filled map with geom_polygon():

ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal))) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c("0" = "blue", "1" = "red"),
    labels = c("Legal", "Illegal"),
    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +  # Removes axis and grid lines
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Explanation
map_data("state"):

Provides U.S. state map data with the group variable required for geom_polygon().
Merge Data:

The left_join adds abortion_illegal to the map data, linking states by their region column.
Plot:

geom_polygon() draws state boundaries.
fill = as.factor(abortion_illegal) colors the states based on the legality of abortion.
Expected Output
Red States: Where abortion is illegal (abortion_illegal = 1).
Blue States: Where abortion is legal (abortion_illegal = 0).
If the issue persists, double-check that your us_map and abortion_status data frames have matching region columns. Let me know if you need further clarification!







You said:
map_data <- abortion_status|>
  left_join(us_map, by = c("region" = "state")) why no value after join?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue is that the us_map data from map_data("state") uses the column name region for state names, not state. Meanwhile, your abortion_status dataset uses region as well, so the column names already align.

Using by = c("region" = "state") will fail because us_map doesn’t have a column named state—it uses region.

Correct Join
You do not need to specify by in this case since both datasets already have a region column with matching state names. Here’s how you can fix the join:

map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = "region")
Check for Issues
If the join still results in missing values, ensure:

Column Names Match:

Check that abortion_status has the state names in a column named region.
The us_map data also uses region for state names.
State Names Match:

Ensure all state names in abortion_status$region are in lowercase, as us_map$region uses lowercase.
Convert state names in abortion_status to lowercase if necessary:
abortion_status <- abortion_status %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region))
Verify Missing Matches:

Check for mismatches using anti_join() to see which rows in abortion_status do not have a match in us_map:
anti_join(abortion_status, us_map, by = "region")
Example Workflow
# Load map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Check column names
head(us_map) # `region` column contains state names in lowercase

# Prepare abortion legality data
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  region = tolower(c("Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", 
                     "Colorado", "Connecticut", "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia")),
  abortion_illegal = c(1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1) # 1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal
)

# Merge data
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = "region")

# Check the result
head(map_data)
Expected Output
The map_data will now have long, lat, group, region, and abortion_illegal.
Rows corresponding to states not in abortion_status will have NA in the abortion_illegal column.
If you’re still seeing no values, let me know, and I’ll help debug further!







You said:
why abortion illegal is na?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If the abortion_illegal column is NA after the left_join, it means there are no matches between the region column in your abortion_status dataset and the region column in the us_map dataset. This can happen for several reasons. Here's how to debug and fix the issue:

Possible Issues and Fixes
1. Mismatch in State Names
The us_map dataset from map_data("state") contains state names in lowercase in the region column.
If the state names in your abortion_status dataset are not all in lowercase, they won’t match.
Solution: Ensure Lowercase State Names Convert all state names in abortion_status$region to lowercase:

abortion_status <- abortion_status %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region))
2. Missing States in abortion_status
If some states in us_map$region do not exist in abortion_status$region, they will have NA values for abortion_illegal.
Solution: Check for Missing Matches Use anti_join() to identify states in us_map that don’t have a match in abortion_status:

anti_join(us_map, abortion_status, by = "region")
This will return a list of state names from us_map that are not found in abortion_status.

If states are missing, update your abortion_status dataset to include them. For example:

# Add missing states to abortion_status
all_states <- unique(us_map$region)
abortion_status <- data.frame(
  region = all_states,
  abortion_illegal = ifelse(all_states %in% c("alabama", "arkansas", "georgia"), 1, 0) # Example logic
)
3. Spelling Errors
Spelling errors in state names in abortion_status$region can cause mismatches.
Solution: Verify State Names Compare unique(abortion_status$region) with unique(us_map$region) to ensure all state names are correct.

Debugging Workflow
Follow these steps to debug the issue:

# Check the unique state names in both datasets
unique(abortion_status$region)
unique(us_map$region)

# Ensure state names in abortion_status are lowercase
abortion_status <- abortion_status %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region))

# Identify mismatches between the two datasets
anti_join(us_map, abortion_status, by = "region")
anti_join(abortion_status, us_map, by = "region")

# Merge data again
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(abortion_status, by = "region")
Expected Fix
After following the steps:

All states in us_map$region will have a matching value in abortion_illegal (either 0 or 1).
Any NA values in abortion_illegal will be resolved.

Step 1: Load Required Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
Step 2: Load USA Map Data
# Load USA map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

    name = "Abortion Status"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Abortion Legality by State",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Key Steps
state_labels:

This data frame contains the centroids of each state using the mean(range(long)) and mean(range(lat)).
geom_text():

Adds labels for each state, positioned at the calculated centroids.
scale_fill_manual():

Assigns colors to states based on their abortion_illegal status.
Expected Output
A U.S. map with:
Red States: Where abortion is illegal (abortion_illegal = 1).
Blue States: Where abortion is legal (abortion_illegal = 0).
State Names: Displayed at the center of each state.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The approach you are referencing uses the sp package's Polygon and its labpt method to calculate centroids for each polygon in a dataset (e.g., a county or state map). Below is how you can adapt this method for state centroids and use it in your plot:

Step 1: Load Required Libraries
library(maps)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(sp)
Step 2: Define getLabelPoint Function
This function calculates the centroid (label point) for a polygon using the Polygon object from the sp package:

getLabelPoint <- function(county) {
  Polygon(county[c("long", "lat")])@labpt
}
Step 3: Calculate Centroids
Use the getLabelPoint function with the by() function to calculate centroids for each state in the map data.

# Load USA map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Calculate centroids for each state
centroids <- by(us_map, us_map$region, getLabelPoint)

# Convert centroids list to a data frame
centroids_df <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)

# Add state names to the centroids data frame
centroids_df$region <- rownames(centroids_df)

# Rename columns for clarity
names(centroids_df) <- c("clong", "clat", "region")
Step 4: Merge State Abbreviations
If you want to display state abbreviations instead of full state names, merge with a lookup table of state abbreviations:

# State abbreviations lookup
state_abbreviations <- data.frame(

Explanation
getLabelPoint:

Computes the centroid (label point) of each polygon (state) using the sp::Polygon object.
Returns the coordinates of the centroid (clong, clat).
Centroid Calculation:

The by() function applies getLabelPoint to each unique region (state) in us_map.
State Abbreviations:

The centroids_df data frame is merged with a lookup table to add state abbreviations.
Map Plot:

geom_polygon() draws the state boundaries.
geom_text() adds abbreviations at the calculated centroids.
Expected Output
A map of the USA with:
State boundaries drawn.
State abbreviations (e.g., "AL", "CA") displayed at the center of each state.

I don't want row names to be number
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to ensure that row names do not default to numbers (or want to reset them), you can explicitly set row names to NULL. Here’s how you can do it:

Step 1: Remove Row Names
After creating centroids_df, reset or remove the row names:

# Remove row names from the centroids_df
rownames(centroids_df) <- NULL
This will ensure that the resulting data frame has no row names, making it clean and consistent.

Step 2: Add a Clear Identifier (Optional)
If you prefer a column as an identifier instead of row names:

# Add a unique identifier column if needed
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(id = row_number())
This way, the data will have a proper id column instead of relying on row names.

Step 3: Check and Confirm
After removing or resetting row names, check your data structure:

print(centroids_df)
Full Workflow Example
Here’s how it fits into the full workflow:

getLabelPoint <- function(county) {
  Polygon(county[c("long", "lat")])@labpt
}

# Calculate centroids
centroids <- by(us_map, us_map$region, getLabelPoint)

# Convert centroids list to a data frame
centroids_df <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)

# Remove row names
rownames(centroids_df) <- NULL

# Add state names and rename columns
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(region = names(centroids)) %>%
  rename(clong = V1, clat = V2)
Final Plot Code
# Merge centroids with abbreviations
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  left_join(state_abbreviations, by = "region")

# Plot the map with state abbreviations
ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = region)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = centroids_df, aes(x = clong, y = clat, label = abbr), size = 3, color = "black") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "USA State Map with Abbreviations",
    caption = "Source: US Map Data"
  )
Expected Output
This ensures:

No row names in centroids_df.
A clear and clean map with abbreviations centered on each state.

rename variable
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To rename variables in a data frame in R, you can use the rename() function from the dplyr package. Here's how you can rename variables step by step:

1. Rename One or More Variables
If you want to rename specific variables:

library(dplyr)

# Rename specific variables
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  rename(
    longitude = clong,  # Rename 'clong' to 'longitude'
    latitude = clat,    # Rename 'clat' to 'latitude'
    state = region      # Rename 'region' to 'state'
  )
2. Rename All Variables (Optional)
If you want to rename all variables at once, provide a named vector:

# Rename all variables
colnames(centroids_df) <- c("longitude", "latitude", "state", "abbreviation")
3. Check Changes
Verify that the renaming is successful:

head(centroids_df)
Full Example Workflow
Here’s the complete workflow incorporating renaming into your centroids_df preparation:

getLabelPoint <- function(county) {
  Polygon(county[c("long", "lat")])@labpt
}

# Calculate centroids
centroids <- by(us_map, us_map$region, getLabelPoint)

# Convert centroids list to a data frame and remove row names
centroids_df <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)
rownames(centroids_df) <- NULL

# Add region names and rename columns
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(region = names(centroids)) %>%
  rename(
    longitude = V1,
    latitude = V2,
    state = region
  )
4. Final Plot with Renamed Variables
# Merge centroids with abbreviations
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  left_join(state_abbreviations, by = "state")

# Plot the map
ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = state)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = centroids_df, aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, label = abbr), size = 3, color = "black") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "USA State Map with Abbreviations",
    caption = "Source: US Map Data"
  )
Output
Variables clong and clat are renamed to longitude and latitude, respectively.
The region column is renamed to state.

rename new variable not this
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you want to create a new renamed variable while keeping the original one, you can use the mutate() function instead of rename(). Here’s how:

1. Rename by Creating a New Variable
You can create a new variable and copy the values from an existing one with a new name:

library(dplyr)

# Add a new variable with the desired name
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(
    longitude_new = clong,  # Create a new variable for 'longitude'
    latitude_new = clat     # Create a new variable for 'latitude'
  )
This keeps the original variables (clong and clat) while adding new variables (longitude_new and latitude_new).

2. Example Workflow
Here’s how it fits into the overall workflow:

getLabelPoint <- function(county) {
  Polygon(county[c("long", "lat")])@labpt
}

# Calculate centroids
centroids <- by(us_map, us_map$region, getLabelPoint)

# Convert centroids list to a data frame and remove row names
centroids_df <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", centroids)
rownames(centroids_df) <- NULL

# Add region names
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(region = names(centroids)) %>%
  rename(clong = V1, clat = V2)

# Add new renamed variables
centroids_df <- centroids_df %>%
  mutate(
    longitude_new = clong,
    latitude_new = clat
  )
3. Result
After running the above, centroids_df will contain:

clong	clat	region	longitude_new	latitude_new
-86.5	32.5	alabama	-86.5	32.5
-150.0	65.0	alaska	-150.0	65.0
...	...	...	...	...
4. Use in Plot
You can use either the old or the new variables in your plots:

# Plot using new variables
ggplot(map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = state)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "black") +
  geom_text(data = centroids_df, aes(x = longitude_new, y = latitude_new, label = region), size = 3, color = "black") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "USA State Map with Abbreviations",
    caption = "Source: US Map Data"
  )
Key Notes
Original Variables: The original clong and clat are retained.
New Variables: longitude_new and latitude_new are added.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In your stan_glmer model, you have specified the formula:

death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + abortion_illegal + year_of_death + (1 | state)
Explanation of the Issue
The term after_injunction * abortion_illegal in R includes:

The main effects of after_injunction and abortion_illegal.
The interaction term between them (after_injunction:abortion_illegal).
However, you have also explicitly included abortion_illegal as a separate term in the formula. This redundancy can cause confusion in the model because after_injunction * abortion_illegal already accounts for the main effect of abortion_illegal.

Correct Formula
To properly include the interaction term without redundancy, remove the extra + abortion_illegal:

death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + year_of_death + (1 | state)
This ensures that:

The main effects of after_injunction and abortion_illegal are included.
The interaction term after_injunction:abortion_illegal is included.
There is no duplication of terms.
Why the Interaction Term Might Not Appear
If the interaction term is still missing in the results:

Collinearity or Zero Variance:

If one of the variables (after_injunction or abortion_illegal) has no variability or perfect collinearity with another variable, the interaction term cannot be estimated.
Check the variability of your predictors:
table(analysis_data$after_injunction)
table(analysis_data$abortion_illegal)
Data Coding Issues:

Ensure that after_injunction and abortion_illegal are properly coded as numeric or factor variables.
Model Diagnostics:

Check the model output for warnings or messages that indicate convergence issues or singular fits.
Debugging Steps
Run the corrected model and review the summary output:

library(rstanarm)

# Corrected model
first_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + year_of_death + (1 | state),
  data = analysis_data,

  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)

# View the summary
summary(first_model)
Check if the interaction term (after_injunction:abortion_illegal) appears in the summary. If it still doesn't, share the output or any warnings for further debugging.

Error in contrasts<-(*tmp*, value = contr.funs[1 + isOF[nn]]) : 
  contrasts can be applied only to factors with 2 or more levels
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that one or more of the variables in your formula is not correctly formatted as a factor with two or more levels. Specifically, R expects categorical variables (factors) to have at least two levels when applying contrasts.

Here’s how you can debug and fix the issue:

Steps to Resolve
1. Identify the Problematic Variable
The likely candidates are after_injunction, abortion_illegal, or state. You can check their structure:

str(analysis_data)
Look at the levels of each variable in your formula. For example:

after_injunction: Should have two levels (e.g., 0 and 1).
abortion_illegal: Should have two levels (e.g., 0 and 1).
state: Should have multiple unique values if it’s used as a grouping factor.
2. Ensure Variables Have Two or More Levels
If any variable has fewer than two levels, fix it:

Check levels:

table(analysis_data$after_injunction)
table(analysis_data$abortion_illegal)
table(analysis_data$state)
Convert numeric to factor (if applicable):

analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    after_injunction = as.factor(after_injunction),
    abortion_illegal = as.factor(abortion_illegal),
    state = as.factor(state)
  )
Verify levels again:

levels(analysis_data$after_injunction)
levels(analysis_data$abortion_illegal)
levels(analysis_data$state)
3. Address Missing Levels
If any variable has fewer than two levels due to missing or filtered data, ensure the dataset contains sufficient variation. For instance:

Add data if some categories were unintentionally removed during preprocessing.
Handle NA values:
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  drop_na(after_injunction, abortion_illegal, state)
4. Update the Model
Once all variables have two or more levels, run the model again:

first_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + year_of_death + (1 | state),
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)
Why This Happens
Single-Level Variables:

A variable with only one unique value (e.g., all 0s) cannot have contrasts applied.
Improper Data Types:

Numeric variables are not automatically treated as categorical unless explicitly converted to factors.
Next Steps
After fixing the levels, run the model and check if the interaction term (after_injunction:abortion_illegal) is included.
If issues persist, share any updated error messages or observations for further assistance.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Your geom_vline() is causing an issue because xintercept expects a numeric or Date object, not a character string. Since your date variable is likely a Date object, you should convert the "2022-06-01" string to a Date object using as.Date().

Here’s the corrected code:

library(ggplot2)

  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2022-06-01"), linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation of Fixes
xintercept with as.Date():

geom_vline() expects a Date object if your x-axis uses dates. The string "2022-06-01" was converted to a Date using as.Date().
Labels Update:

Updated labs() to correctly describe the y-axis as "Death Rate."
Minimal Theme:

theme_minimal() retains a clean appearance.
Expected Output
A scatter plot of death_rate over time (date).
Faceted by abortion_illegal (likely 0 = legal, 1 = illegal).
A dashed vertical line at June 1, 2022, across all facets to indicate the policy change.

Explanation of Changes
Custom Labels:

Created a named vector facet_labels where 0 is mapped to "Legal" and 1 to "Illegal".
labeller in facet_wrap():

Used as_labeller(facet_labels) to apply the custom labels to the facets.

  scale_x_date(limits = c(min(analysis_data$date), as.Date("2022-12-01"))) +
  theme_minimal()
Explanation of Changes
scale_x_date():

limits = c(min(analysis_data$date), as.Date("2022-12-01")) sets the x-axis to start at the earliest date in the data and end at 2022-12-01.
Dynamic Start Date:

min(analysis_data$date) ensures the start of the axis matches the minimum date in your dataset.
Fixed End Date:

The x-axis will stop at 2022-12-01.

You said:
label
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add labels to your data points or any additional text annotation, you can use the geom_text() or geom_label() functions. For instance, if you want to add specific labels to data points or display certain values on your facets, here’s how you can do it:

Add Labels to Points
If you want to label each data point with a specific value (e.g., death_rate or state), you can use geom_text().

library(ggplot2)

# Custom labels for facets
facet_labels <- c("0" = "Legal", "1" = "Illegal")

analysis_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = death_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_rate, 1)), vjust = -0.5, size = 3, alpha = 0.8) +  # Add labels
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Death Rate") +
  facet_wrap(vars(abortion_illegal), nrow = 2, labeller = as_labeller(facet_labels)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2022-06-01"), linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(min(analysis_data$date), as.Date("2022-12-01"))) +
  theme_minimal()
aes(label = round(death_rate, 1)): Displays the death_rate value (rounded to 1 decimal place) as labels on each point.
vjust = -0.5: Adjusts the vertical position of the labels relative to the points.
size = 3: Controls text size.
Label Facets
If you want to add text annotations specific to each facet, use annotate() inside facet_wrap() or geom_text() with a dataset.

Example:
Add "Legal" or "Illegal" inside each facet:

library(ggplot2)

facet_labels <- c("0" = "Legal", "1" = "Illegal")

analysis_data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = death_rate)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Death Rate") +
  facet_wrap(vars(abortion_illegal), nrow = 2, labeller = as_labeller(facet_labels)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.Date("2022-06-01"), linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_x_date(limits = c(min(analysis_data$date), as.Date("2022-12-01"))) +
  geom_text(
    data = data.frame(abortion_illegal = c(0, 1), x = as.Date("2022-01-01"), y = max(analysis_data$death_rate), label = c("Legal States", "Illegal States")),
    aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),
    inherit.aes = FALSE, size = 4, fontface = "bold", color = "blue"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
Annotation Dataset:
Create a small dataset with abortion_illegal, x (position), y (position), and label columns.
This dataset determines what text to show in each facet.
Customize Labels
Adjust size, color, or fontface in geom_text() or geom_label().
Use inherit.aes = FALSE to override the default aes() if needed.

Explanation
limits = c(start, end):

Ensures the x-axis starts at 2020-01-01 and ends at 2022-12-01.
date_breaks = "6 months":

Specifies that the x-axis labels appear every 6 months.
date_labels = "%Y-%m":

Formats the labels as "Year-Month" (e.g., 2020-06).
Expected Result
The x-axis will display dates starting from 2020-01-01 and end at 2022-12-01.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The overturning of Roe v. Wade marked a significant turning point in U.S. legal and social history. On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization effectively ended the constitutional protection for abortion rights established nearly five decades earlier in 1973. Roe v. Wade had guaranteed a federal right to abortion, balancing a woman's right to privacy with state interests in regulating the procedure. However, the Dobbs ruling returned the authority to regulate abortion to individual states, leading to a patchwork of laws across the country. Some states immediately implemented "trigger laws" banning abortion, while others expanded protections. This legal shift intensified debates over reproductive rights, public health, and social justice, highlighting disparities in access to abortion services and their implications for health outcomes, particularly in states with restrictive policies.

how banning of abortion related to infant mortality rate
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The banning of abortion can influence infant mortality rates through various interconnected pathways. Restrictive abortion laws may lead to an increase in unintended or high-risk pregnancies, particularly among individuals facing socioeconomic disadvantages or limited access to healthcare. These pregnancies are often associated with higher rates of adverse outcomes, such as preterm births, low birth weights, and complications during delivery, which elevate the risk of infant mortality. Furthermore, the lack of access to abortion services can exacerbate disparities in maternal health and limit resources available for prenatal and postnatal care, further impacting infant survival rates. These factors highlight how restrictive abortion policies can indirectly contribute to higher infant mortality rates.

Death Rate Definition:

The death rate refers to the number of deaths in a specified population during a particular time period, expressed per unit of population (e.g., per 1,000 or 100,000 individuals). It provides a measure of mortality within the population and is often used to assess health outcomes and compare trends across groups or regions. Rates labeled as "Unreliable" occur when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator, as these figures do not meet the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards for reliability or precision.

Interpretation of the Graph:

The histogram illustrates the distribution of infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) based on the available data. The majority of infant death rates cluster around lower values, with a peak observed between 5 and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants. As the death rate increases, the frequency of occurrences decreases, indicating that higher infant death rates are relatively rare. There are few instances where the rate exceeds 20 deaths per 1,000 infants, suggesting these are outliers. Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance of lower infant death rates in the dataset.

A suitable color for the bars in the histogram could depend on the context and the emphasis you want to create:

Blue tones (e.g., light or medium blue) are calming and professional, often used for data representation to signify neutrality.
Teal or green tones are soft and visually appealing, suitable for health-related data.
Orange or yellow tones can add energy but should be used carefully to avoid overwhelming the visualization.
Neutral tones (e.g., gray or light gray) are a safe choice for clarity and minimal distraction, as used in the current graph.
For your graph, if you want to keep the focus on the data without additional visual emphasis, a shade of blue or teal would be a good choice to align with health-related themes while remaining professional and clear.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Interpretation of the Graph:

The graph shows trends in infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) over time in states where abortion is illegal (top panel) versus states where abortion remains legal (bottom panel). Each point represents an observation, with lines and shaded regions indicating smoothed trends and confidence intervals.

In illegal states, the infant death rate shows a slight upward trend after June 2022 (marked by the dashed line, representing the overturn of Roe v. Wade), suggesting a potential increase in mortality following the abortion ban.
In legal states, the infant death rate appears relatively stable over the same period, with no notable changes before or after June 2022.
The contrast between the two panels highlights potential differences in infant mortality trends associated with abortion legality, with illegal states showing higher variability and a slightly elevated rate after the policy change.
This visualization suggests that abortion bans may correlate with changes in infant mortality, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the causal relationship.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue of NA values in the death_rate column after the join likely arises from a mismatch between the state names in your death dataframe and the region names in the us_map data. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Check the Case Consistency
You already converted the state column in the death dataframe to lowercase using tolower(state). Ensure that the region column in us_map is also in lowercase.

us_map <- us_map %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region))
2. Check for Extra Whitespace
There might be extra whitespace in either the state or region columns. You can trim the whitespace using str_trim from the stringr package.

library(stringr)
death <- death %>%
  mutate(state = str_trim(state))
us_map <- us_map %>%
  mutate(region = str_trim(region))
3. Check for Naming Differences
The names in state and region might not exactly match due to variations like "District of Columbia" versus "dc" or similar issues. Verify the names in both columns:

unique(death$state)
unique(us_map$region)
If mismatches are found, you can manually standardize the names or create a mapping table to correct them.

4. Check for Missing States
Some states might be missing in either the death or us_map data. Confirm that all states in the region column of us_map are present in the state column of death.

setdiff(unique(us_map$region), unique(death$state))
setdiff(unique(death$state), unique(us_map$region))
Example Fix:
Once you identify the issue, ensure the columns align. Here’s how to fix mismatches:

# Example of fixing mismatches (if needed)
death <- death %>%
  mutate(state = case_when(
    state == "dc" ~ "district of columbia",

# Create a dataframe of all U.S. states (already in lowercase)
state <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(c(
    "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", 
    "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana", 
    "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", 
    "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", 
    "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", 
    "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", 
    "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont", 
    "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
  ))
)

# Summarize death rates by state
death <- analysis_data |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(death_rate = mean(death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Full join to ensure all states are represented
death_full <- state |>
  full_join(death, by = "state")
Explanation:
state DataFrame: Contains all U.S. states in lowercase.
death DataFrame: Summarizes the average death rate for each state in analysis_data.
full_join():
Ensures all states from state are included, even if they are missing from analysis_data.
States not in analysis_data will have NA in the death_rate column.
Example Output:
state	death_rate
alabama	7.8
alaska	NA
arizona	8.2
arkansas	NA
california	6.5
...	...
This ensures states without data in analysis_data are explicitly marked as NA.

To add states from the state dataset that are not in analysis_data and assign NA to the death_rate, you can use the following code:

# Create a dataframe of all U.S. states (already in lowercase)
state <- data.frame(
  state = tolower(c(
    "Alabama", "Alaska", "Arizona", "Arkansas", "California", "Colorado", "Connecticut", 
    "Delaware", "Florida", "Georgia", "Hawaii", "Idaho", "Illinois", "Indiana", 
    "Iowa", "Kansas", "Kentucky", "Louisiana", "Maine", "Maryland", "Massachusetts", 
    "Michigan", "Minnesota", "Mississippi", "Missouri", "Montana", "Nebraska", 
    "Nevada", "New Hampshire", "New Jersey", "New Mexico", "New York", "North Carolina", 
    "North Dakota", "Ohio", "Oklahoma", "Oregon", "Pennsylvania", "Rhode Island", 
    "South Carolina", "South Dakota", "Tennessee", "Texas", "Utah", "Vermont", 
    "Virginia", "Washington", "West Virginia", "Wisconsin", "Wyoming"
  ))
)

# Summarize death rates by state from analysis_data
death <- analysis_data |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(death_rate = mean(death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Add missing states from the state dataset
death_full <- state |>
  left_join(death, by = "state")

# Check the result
death_full
Explanation:
state Dataset: Contains all state names in lowercase.
death Dataset: Summarizes the average death rate for states in analysis_data.
left_join():
Joins state with death, keeping all states in state.
States not found in analysis_data will have NA for death_rate.
Example Output:
state	death_rate
alabama	7.8
alaska	NA
arizona	8.2
arkansas	NA
california	6.5
...	...
This ensures states missing from analysis_data are included in the final death_full dataset with NA values for death_rate.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the death_rate variable is not correctly matched to the map_data in the fill aesthetic, likely because of an incomplete or mismatched join between the spatial data (map_data) and your death_rate data. Here's how to resolve the issue:

Solution:
Ensure Proper Join: The death_rate must be properly joined to the map_data before plotting. Confirm that both datasets have a common variable for merging, such as region (in lowercase state names).

Check for Missing Values: Ensure that all regions in map_data have corresponding death_rate values. Missing matches will result in NA values, causing this error.

Updated Code:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Load map data for U.S. states
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Ensure proper join
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(death_full, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the map with death_rate
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(fill = death_rate, x = long, y = lat, group = group),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradient(
    name = "Death Rate",

  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024"
  )
Key Changes:
left_join: Joins death_full with us_map using the region column to ensure death_rate is included in the map_data.
scale_fill_gradient: Applies a gradient to the death_rate variable. Replace with scale_fill_manual only if using discrete categories.
na.value: Sets a color (e.g., grey50) for states with missing death_rate.
Expected Output:
A choropleth map of U.S. states, with the death_rate shown using a color gradient, and states with no data shaded in a neutral color.

ChatGPT said:

The error occurs when the fill aesthetic, which represents death_rate, does not align correctly with the map_data. This is typically caused by mismatched joins or missing data. Here’s how to create a choropleth map that avoids this issue:

Steps to Resolve:
Ensure Proper Join: The spatial data (map_data("state")) should be joined with the data containing death_rate (death_full) on a common key, such as region.

Check for Missing Matches: Use setdiff() to ensure all region names in map_data exist in the death_full data. Address mismatches manually if needed.

Assign NA for Missing Data: States not present in death_full should have NA for death_rate.

Corrected Code:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Load US map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Ensure the state names are in lowercase for the join
death_full <- death_full %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Join map data with death rates
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(death_full, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Check for missing data
missing_states <- setdiff(us_map$region, death_full$state)
print(missing_states) # Ensure all states are accounted for

# Create the choropleth map

    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"

    name = "Death Rate",
    low = "lightblue",
    high = "red",
    na.value = "grey50"

  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024"
  )
Explanation:
left_join(): Ensures death_rate is correctly added to map_data by matching region in us_map and state in death_full.

setdiff(): Identifies states in us_map that are not present in death_full.

scale_fill_gradient(): Creates a continuous gradient for death_rate values, with NA values displayed in a neutral color (grey50).

geom_polygon(): Plots the polygons representing states with their respective death_rate.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
Mismatched State Names: Ensure all state names match exactly between the datasets (case-sensitive).
Missing Data: Handle NA values with a neutral color in scale_fill_gradient.
Expected Outcome:
A choropleth map displaying the death_rate across U.S. states, with missing data highlighted in a neutral color. Let me know if you encounter further issues!

  continuous(palette = "Set1")
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The function scale_fill_continuous() does not have a palette argument. If you want to use a continuous scale with predefined color palettes (like "Set1"), you need to use scale_fill_gradient() or scale_fill_viridis_c(). However, "Set1" is a discrete palette and not suitable for continuous variables. Instead, you can choose another appropriate gradient or manually define colors.

Example with Gradient:
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradient(
    name = "Death Rate",
    low = "blue",
    high = "red",
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024"
  )
Alternative: Use viridis Palette
If you prefer a colorblind-friendly continuous palette, use scale_fill_viridis_c():

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Death Rate",
    option = "C", # Choose from "A", "B", "C", etc.
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024"
  )
Why Not "Set1"?
The "Set1" palette is designed for categorical (discrete) data, not continuous variables like death_rate. For continuous data, use gradients or specialized continuous palettes like viridis.

ℹ Example values: NA, NA, NA, NA, and NA
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the fill aesthetic, in this case death_rate, contains only NA values. This likely happened because the left_join() between map_data and your death dataset failed to properly merge the death_rate values.

Here's how to debug and fix this issue:

Steps to Fix:
Check the left_join Output: Ensure the left_join successfully matched states from death_full to us_map.
# Check the joined data
head(map_data)
summary(map_data$death_rate)  # Should not be all NA
Verify State Name Consistency: Ensure state names in both us_map$region and death_full$state are consistent.
# Check for unmatched state names
setdiff(us_map$region, death_full$state)  # Names in map but not in death_full
setdiff(death_full$state, us_map$region)  # Names in death_full but not in map
If there are mismatches, fix them manually or use a mapping table.
Handle Missing Data: If some states legitimately have no death_rate, ensure they display as NA in the plot (e.g., grey).
Corrected Code:
Once the issue is identified and resolved, use the following code for plotting:

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Load map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Ensure state names match
death_full <- death_full %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Join map data with death rates
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(death_full, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the choropleth map
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Death Rate",
    option = "C",  # Choose color option
    na.value = "grey50"  # Display NA values in grey
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024"
  )
Additional Debugging Tips:
If death_rate is still NA: Re-examine the death_full and us_map datasets. Focus on consistent column names and values.
If only some states are missing: Use a neutral color (grey50) for missing data in scale_fill_viridis_c().

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To add "Unknown" (represented by grey) in the legend of your map for NA values, you can specify it in the labs() function and scale_fill_viridis_c() to customize the legend appropriately.

Updated Code:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Load map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Ensure state names match
death_full <- death_full %>%
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Join map data with death rates
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(death_full, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the choropleth map with "Unknown" in legend

  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Death Rate",
    option = "C",  # Choose color option
    na.value = "grey50"  # Display NA values in grey
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates by State",
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nDate as of Nov. 19, 2024\nGrey indicates unknown death rates"
  )
Explanation:
na.value = "grey50": Sets NA values (unknown states) to be displayed as grey in the map.
labs(caption = ...): Adds a note in the caption to explain that grey indicates unknown death rates.
Legend Behavior: For the "Unknown" category to appear in the legend, ensure the na.value color is distinct and acknowledged in the explanation (e.g., grey = unknown).
Expected Outcome:
The map will display states with known death_rate in a color gradient and states with NA values in grey. The legend and caption will clearly indicate that grey represents "Unknown" values.

Your code includes an issue with the labels argument in scale_fill_viridis_c() because labels cannot directly map "NA" to "unknown" in this context. To achieve this, you need to use a custom legend label by handling NA values directly in the dataset. Here's how to fix it:

Corrected Code:
# Add a column for `death_rate_label` to handle NA values

library(ggnewscale)
ChatGPT said:

The ggnewscale package allows you to add multiple color or fill scales to a single ggplot, which is useful when you want to apply different aesthetic mappings to different layers in the same plot.

Here’s an example of how to use ggnewscale to add a second fill scale to a map:

Example Code
library(ggplot2)
library(ggnewscale)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)

# Load US map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Create mock data for demonstration
death_full <- us_map %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(region)) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(death_rate = runif(50, 5, 10)) %>% # Random death rates
  ungroup()

# Join map data with death rates
map_data <- us_map %>%
  left_join(death_full, by = c("region" = "region"))

# Plot with multiple fill scales
ggplot() +
  # First scale for death rate
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_gradient(
    name = "Death Rate",
    low = "lightblue",
    high = "red",
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  new_scale_fill() + # Add a new fill scale
  
  # Second scale for another variable (e.g., abortion legality)
  geom_polygon(
    data = map_data,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = factor(sample(c("Legal", "Illegal"), 50, replace = TRUE))),
    color = NA,
    alpha = 0.5
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Abortion Legality",
    values = c("Legal" = "green", "Illegal" = "purple"),
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Multiple Fill Scales Example",
    caption = "Source: Example Data"
  )
Key Points:
new_scale_fill(): Allows you to introduce a new fill scale after the first one.
scale_fill_gradient(): Used for continuous data (e.g., death_rate).
scale_fill_manual(): Used for categorical data (e.g., abortion legality).
alpha: Adjusts transparency for overlapping layers.
Expected Output:
The map will display two different fill scales: one for death_rate (a gradient) and another for a categorical variable like abortion legality (distinct colors).

  scale_color_manual(name=NULL, labels="NA") not show
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The issue is that scale_color_manual() is not applicable because your aesthetic mapping for the polygons uses fill and not color. To include "NA" as a label in the legend for states with missing death_rate, you should use the scale_fill_viridis_c() directly.

Corrected Code:
To add a label for NA in the legend, you need to handle it within the fill aesthetic. Unfortunately, scale_fill_viridis_c() does not allow direct custom labels for NA. Instead, you can use na.value for the visual representation and describe it in the caption or create a custom legend.

Here’s the corrected code:

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(ggnewscale)

# Summarize death rates by state
death <- analysis_data |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(death_rate = mean(death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Load US map data

# Join map data with death rates
death_full <- us_map |>
  full_join(death, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the map
ggplot() +
  # First layer: Fill with death_rate
  geom_polygon(
    data = death_full,

    option = "C",
    na.value = "grey50"  # Color for NA values
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nGrey indicates missing data\nDate as of December, 2022"
  )
Explanation:
Handling NA:

na.value in scale_fill_viridis_c() sets the color for missing values (NA).
Add a description for the NA color (e.g., grey) in the labs() function under caption.
Why scale_color_manual() Fails:

scale_color_manual() works for color aesthetics, but here, fill is used for the polygons.
Use scale_fill_* instead for legends related to fill.
theme_void():

Ensures a clean map background with no gridlines or axes.
Result:
The map will show:

A color gradient for death_rate using viridis.
States with missing data (NA in death_rate) shaded in grey.
A legend with the Infant Death Rate scale and a note about missing data in the caption.

reverse color
ChatGPT said:

To reverse the color gradient for death_rate, you can add the argument direction = -1 to scale_fill_viridis_c(). This reverses the color mapping.

Updated Code:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(ggnewscale)

# Summarize death rates by state
death <- analysis_data |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(death_rate = mean(death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Load US map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Join map data with death rates
death_full <- us_map |>
  full_join(death, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the map
ggplot() +
  # First layer: Fill with death_rate
  geom_polygon(
    data = death_full,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Infant Death Rate\n(per 1,000 live births)",
    option = "C",
    direction = -1,  # Reverse the color gradient
    na.value = "grey50"  # Color for NA values
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nGrey indicates missing data\nDate as of December, 2022"
  )
Key Changes:
direction = -1:
Reverses the color mapping so that the high values correspond to lighter colors and low values correspond to darker colors (or vice versa, depending on the option).
Output:
The map will now display a reversed color gradient for death_rate, ensuring high and low values are visually represented in the opposite manner of the default. States with missing data will still be shown in grey.

breaks
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To customize the breaks for the death_rate scale in your map, you can use the breaks and labels arguments in scale_fill_viridis_c().

Here’s how you can modify the scale to include custom breaks:

Updated Code with Breaks:
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(maps)
library(ggnewscale)

# Summarize death rates by state
death <- analysis_data |>
  group_by(state) |>
  summarise(death_rate = mean(death_rate, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  mutate(state = tolower(state))

# Load US map data
us_map <- map_data("state")

# Join map data with death rates
death_full <- us_map |>
  full_join(death, by = c("region" = "state"))

# Plot the map
ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(
    data = death_full,
    aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate),
    color = "black"
  ) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Infant Death Rate\n(per 1,000 live births)",
    option = "C",
    direction = -1,  # Reverse the color gradient
    na.value = "grey50",  # Color for NA values
    breaks = c(5, 7, 9),  # Custom breaks for the color legend
    labels = c("Low (5)", "Medium (7)", "High (9)")  # Custom labels for breaks
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    caption = "Source: Center for Reproductive Rights\nGrey indicates missing data\nDate as of December, 2022"
  )
Key Arguments:
breaks:

Specifies the values at which the legend should display tick marks.
Example: breaks = c(5, 7, 9) for showing only these values on the legend.
labels:

Customizes the labels for the breaks.
Example: labels = c("Low (5)", "Medium (7)", "High (9)") makes the legend more descriptive.
direction = -1:

Reverses the gradient, ensuring high values are mapped to light colors (or vice versa).
Output:
The map will display:

A reversed color gradient.
A legend with custom breaks and descriptive labels.
Grey for missing data (NA), as specified in na.value.

To change the position of labs() in a ggplot, you can use the theme() function to adjust the alignment and positioning. For example:

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = death_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Infant Death Rate\n(per 1,000 live births)",
    option = "C",
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates Across U.S. States",
    subtitle = "Data as of December 2022",
    caption = "Grey indicates missing data\nSource: CDC WONDER"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),  # Center-align title
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),             # Center-align subtitle
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 8)       # Right-align caption
  )
This will center the title and subtitle while positioning the caption at the bottom right corner of the plot. You can adjust hjust values to fine-tune the positioning.

change the labs of color
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To change the label for the color scale in a ggplot, you need to modify the scale_fill_viridis_c() or any other scale function you are using for color/fill. Here's how you can do it:

ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = death_full, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = death_rate), color = "black") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(
    name = "Infant Death Rate\n(per 1,000 live births)",  # Change the label here
    option = "C",
    na.value = "grey50"
  ) +
  theme_void() +
  labs(
    title = "Infant Death Rates Across U.S. States",
    subtitle = "Data as of December 2022",
    caption = "Grey indicates missing data\nSource: CDC WONDER"
  ) +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 8)
  )
Explanation:
The name argument in scale_fill_viridis_c() sets the label for the legend associated with the fill color.
Replace "Infant Death Rate\n(per 1,000 live births)" with any text you want to customize the label.
If you're using a different type of scale (e.g., scale_fill_manual() or scale_color_continuous()), apply the same name argument in that function.

  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom", # Moves the legend to the bottom
    legend.title = element_text(face = "bold"), # Makes the title bold
    legend.text = element_text(size = 8), # Adjusts legend text size
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = "bold"), 
    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 8)
  )
Key Modifications:
legend.position = "bottom": Moves the legend to the bottom of the plot. Other options include "top", "left", or "right".
legend.title and legend.text: Adjust the style of the legend title and text (e.g., bold, size).
Flexibility: You can also use coordinates to position the legend exactly where you want with legend.position = c(x, y), where x and y are values between 0 and 1 representing the relative position within the plot area.
This approach will let you control the positioning and appearance of the legend (color labs).

To create a variable that represents the product between Abortion Legality and After Injunction, you can use the mutate() function in R. Here’s how you can define it:

analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    legality_injunction = abortion_illegal * after_injunction
  )
Explanation:
abortion_illegal: Represents whether abortion is illegal in the state (1 = illegal, 0 = legal).
after_injunction: Represents whether the time is after the injunction (1 = after, 0 = before).
legality_injunction: The product of the two variables. This interaction term represents the combined effect of abortion legality and the time after the injunction. It equals 1 only for observations where abortion is illegal and the time is after the injunction, and 0 otherwise.
This new variable can then be used in your analysis as a predictor or interaction term in models.

```{r create-interaction-term, echo=TRUE}
# Create the interaction term
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(

ChatGPT
To include the description of the interaction term in LaTeX, you can write it like this:

\section*{Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction}

To account for the combined effect of abortion legality and the timing after the injunction, we construct an interaction term. This variable is defined as the product of \textit{Abortion Legality} (1 if abortion is illegal, 0 otherwise) and \textit{After Injunction} (1 if the observation is after the injunction, 0 otherwise). The resulting interaction term equals 1 when abortion is illegal and the time is after the injunction, and 0 otherwise. This term is included in the analysis to evaluate the joint impact of these factors on infant death rates.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here’s how you can incorporate the explanation of the interaction term with the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method in LaTeX:

\section*{Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction (Difference-in-Difference)}

To evaluate the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates, we utilize the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method. As part of this approach, we construct an interaction term defined as the product of \textit{Abortion Legality} and \textit{After Injunction}. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Abortion Legality}: A binary variable that equals 1 if abortion is illegal in the mother's state of residence and 0 otherwise.
    \item \textit{After Injunction}: A binary variable that equals 1 if the observation occurs after the injunction and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}

The interaction term, \textit{Legality × Injunction}, captures the combined effect of abortion legality and the timing of the injunction. In the DID framework, this term isolates the differential change in infant death rates between states that banned abortion and those where it remained legal, before and after the injunction. This allows us to measure the causal effect of abortion injunctions on infant mortality.

```{r create-interaction-term, echo=TRUE}
# Create the interaction term
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    legality_injunction = as.numeric(abortion_illegal) * as.numeric(after_injunction)

turn factor to numeric data?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To convert a factor variable to numeric in R, you need to first convert it to a character and then to numeric. Directly converting a factor to numeric will give you the underlying factor levels, which may not be what you want.

Here’s how you can do it:

Example Code
# Example of converting a factor to numeric
factor_variable <- factor(c("10", "20", "30"))

# Step 1: Convert factor to character
char_variable <- as.character(factor_variable)

# Step 2: Convert character to numeric
numeric_variable <- as.numeric(char_variable)

# Output the result
print(numeric_variable)
Explanation
Why Two Steps?

If you use as.numeric(factor_variable) directly, it will return the internal integer codes of the factor levels, not the actual numeric values.
For example:
as.numeric(factor(c("10", "20", "30")))
# Output: 1, 2, 3 (corresponding to the factor levels)
Correct Approach:

Convert the factor to character with as.character(factor_variable).
Convert the character to numeric with as.numeric(char_variable).
Incorporating in dplyr::mutate
If you're working with a dataset and need to perform the conversion in a pipeline, use this:

analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    abortion_illegal = as.numeric(as.character(abortion_illegal)),
    after_injunction = as.numeric(as.character(after_injunction))
  )
This will ensure your factor variables are properly converted to numeric without losing their actual values.

The table illustrates the average infant death rate (per 1,000 live births) based on the interaction between abortion legality and the timing of the injunction. The variable categorization indicates two distinct groups: '0' represents states where abortion is legal both before and after the injunction or where abortion is illegal only before the injunction, while '1' denotes states where abortion is illegal following the injunction. The data reveal that states classified as '1'—those with both restrictive abortion laws and enforcement after the injunction—exhibit a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 per 1,000 live births. In contrast, states in the '0' category, encompassing a mix of legal and restricted abortion conditions without enforcement post-injunction, show a lower average rate of 7.9 per 1,000 live births. This difference underscores potential health disparities that arise in states with more restrictive abortion policies implemented after the overturn of Roe v. Wade. The elevated death rate in states enforcing abortion bans post-injunction could be attributed to factors such as increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies, diminished access to comprehensive maternal healthcare, and social or economic inequities exacerbated by restrictive policies. This observation highlights the need for further investigation into the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws on maternal and infant health outcomes across different state policies.

The table highlights average infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) based on abortion legality and injunction timing. States categorized as '1', where abortion became illegal after the injunction, show a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 compared to 7.9 in '0' states, where abortion remained legal or restrictions were not enforced post-injunction. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies and their enforcement may contribute to higher infant mortality, potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies, reduced access to maternal healthcare, and exacerbated social or economic disparities. These findings emphasize the potential public health consequences of restrictive abortion laws.

The table highlights average infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) based on the interaction between abortion legality and injunction timing. A value of '0' includes cases where abortion was either legal or illegal before the injunction or legal after it, showing an average infant death rate of 7.9. In contrast, a value of '1' represents states where abortion became illegal after the injunction, with a higher average infant death rate of 8.3. This indicates that the enforcement of restrictive abortion policies following the injunction may contribute to elevated infant mortality, potentially linked to increased high-risk pregnancies and diminished access to maternal healthcare resources.

The U.S. has the highest infant mortality rate among peer countries. Restrictive abortion laws may contribute to poor infant health outcomes. This ecological study investigated the association between county-level infant mortality and state-level abortion access legislation in the U.S. from 2014 to 2018. A multivariable regression analysis with the outcome of county-level infant mortality rates, controlling for the primary exposure of state-level abortion laws, and county-level factors, county-level distance to an abortion facility, and state Medicaid expansion status was performed. Incidence rate ratios and 95% CIs were reported. Analyses were conducted in 2022–2023. There were 113,397 infant deaths among 19,559,660 live births (infant mortality rate=5.79 deaths/1,000 live births; 95% CI=5.75, 5.82). Black infant mortality rate (10.69/1,000) was more than twice the White infant mortality rate (4.87/1,000). In the multivariable model, increased infant mortality rates were seen in states with ≥8 restrictive laws, with the most restrictive (11–12 laws) having a 16% increased infant mortality level (adjusted incidence rate ratios=1.162; 95% CI=1.103, 1.224). Increased infant mortality rates were associated with increased county-level Black race individuals (adjusted incidence rate ratios=1.031; 95% CI=1.026, 1.037), high school education (adjusted incidence rate ratios=1.018; 95% CI=1.008, 1.029), maternal smoking (adjusted incidence rate ratios=1.025; 95% CI=1.018, 1.033), and inadequate prenatal care (adjusted incidence rate ratios=1.045; 95% CI=1.036, 1.055).

 It is estimated that the Supreme Court decision in Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization will leave approximately 33 million US women in states without available abortion services. Even before this decision, there was wide variation in abortion access across the United States. In 2019, 43% of reproductive-age women lived in states with policies overall restrictive to abortion because of the 26 abortion bans that had been enacted, with many more introduced. In contrast, other states have passed laws supportive of and protective of abortion. Many laws restricting abortion were supposedly aimed at protecting women's health by regulating abortion facilities as ambulatory surgery centers, dictating the types of health care providers who can perform abortion, and requiring admitting privileges to hospitals for clinicians providing abortion care. Opponents of these regulations assert that they are designed to restrict access without evidence that they decrease risks associated with abortion. These laws purporting to protect women with safer abortions have actually done the opposite; restricted abortion access results in increased pregnancy-related deaths. The focus of abortion regulations and restrictions is also aimed at protecting the fetus (and subsequent neonate), but prior studies have demonstrated an association between restricted access to abortion and increased infant mortality. Moreover, prior studies demonstrated that abortion restrictions increase maternal and infant mortality. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the association between state-level abortion legislation and all-cause mortality among females of reproductive age and maternal, fetal, and infant mortality. This study compared mortality rates in states categorized as supportive, moderate, and restrictive with regard to their laws. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) database was used. The association between supportive, moderate, and restrictive state abortion regulations and all-cause mortality in reproductive-age females was estimated using generalized estimating equations. The primary study outcome was all-cause mortality in reproductive-age females (aged 15–49 years). Issues examined included specific, common legal restrictions placed on abortion, including in-person counseling, restrictions on insurance coverage, waiting periods, requiring inaccurate or misleading counseling to pregnant women (such as information on medical abortion reversal or fetal personhood), prohibiting telemedicine for medication abortion, and requiring parental consent for minors. Secondary outcomes included maternal mortality, fetal mortality, and infant mortality. All-cause mortality in reproductive-age females was defined as death at a reported age of 15 to 49 years. Compared with restrictive states, moderate and supportive states were not associated with a significant decrease in all-cause mortality, and maternal mortality (per 100,000 live births) was significantly lower in moderate (25.79; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.88–21.70), but not supportive states (22.51; 95% CI, 26.75–1.72). In both moderate (20.56; 95% CI, 21.09–20.04) and supportive (21.10; 95% CI, 21.56–20.64) states, infant mortality (per 1000 live births) was significantly lower. In moderate states, fetal mortality was significantly lower (20.69; 95% CI, 21.18–20.20) but not in supportive states (20.64; 95% CI, 21.14–0.13). With each additional abortion regulation, there was an increase in both maternal mortality (1.09; 95% CI, 0.36–1.82) and infant mortality (0.20; 95% CI, 0.12–0.26). These findings show that compared with restrictive laws, moderate state abortion legislation is associated with lower rates of maternal, fetal, and infant mortality but not lower all-cause mortality in reproductive-age females. Restrictive laws enacted with the purported intent of protecting women's health and fetal health by regulating abortion fail to do so and do not decrease all-cause mortality in reproductive-age women or maternal mortality. Repealing certain types of laws may decrease all-cause mortality in reproductive-age females, maternal mortality, and infant mortality. Allowing an abortion at any gestational age does not substantially increase fetal death rates compared with states that restricted termination after a certain gestational age.

Here’s a summary of the key findings:

Research suggests that restrictive abortion laws in the United States are associated with higher maternal, fetal, and infant mortality rates. States categorized as having "moderate" abortion legislation demonstrated significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to restrictive states. In contrast, "supportive" states showed significantly lower infant mortality rates (21.10 per 1,000 live births) but not a significant decrease in maternal mortality. Each additional abortion regulation correlated with an increase in maternal mortality (by 1.09 per 100,000) and infant mortality (by 0.20 per 1,000). Restrictive laws, purportedly aimed at protecting women's and fetal health, fail to achieve these outcomes and may instead exacerbate mortality risks. Repealing certain restrictive abortion laws could reduce maternal, fetal, and infant mortality rates, suggesting the need for policies that enhance access to abortion services.

Restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. are linked to higher maternal, fetal, and infant mortality rates, with moderate legislation showing significantly lower mortality compared to restrictive states. Each additional abortion regulation increases maternal mortality by 1.09 per 100,000 and infant mortality by 0.20 per 1,000, underscoring the potential health benefits of repealing restrictive laws.

Before the overturn of Roe v. Wade, many researchers have already explored the impacts of restrictive abortion laws on the Infant Mortality Rate. Research @Burdick2024 found that restrictive state-level abortion laws in the U.S. are associated with a 16% increase in infant mortality rates in states with 11–12 restrictive laws in 2014-2018, particularly affecting counties with higher proportions of Black populations, inadequate prenatal care, and higher rates of maternal smoking. @Harper2023 highlights that restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. are linked to higher maternal, fetal, and infant mortality rates, with moderate legislation showing significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to restrictive states. Each additional abortion regulation increases maternal mortality by 1.09 per 100,000 and infant mortality by 0.20 per 1,000, underscoring the potential health benefits of repealing restrictive laws. add trans words

The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, in the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision ended nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights. This ruling returned authority over abortion regulations to individual states, resulting in a patchwork of laws across the country. The shift sparked debates over reproductive rights and public health, underscoring disparities in access to abortion services and their impact on health outcomes in states with restrictive policies.

The banning of abortion not only raises maternal mortality rates—evidenced by a 56% increase in Texas from 2019 to 2022 [@nbcnews]—but also influences infant mortality rates. Restrictive abortion laws can lead to more unintended or high-risk pregnancies, particularly among disadvantaged individuals with limited healthcare access, resulting in higher rates of preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications that elevate infant mortality.

# Introduction

The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, through the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ended nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights. This landmark ruling shifted authority over abortion regulations to individual states, creating a patchwork of laws nationwide. The decision reignited debates about reproductive rights and public health, highlighting disparities in access to abortion services and their effects on health outcomes, especially in states with restrictive policies.

Banning abortion has been linked to a rise in maternal mortality rates, with Texas experiencing a 56% increase from 2019 to 2022 [@nbcnews]. Restrictive abortion laws can also impact infant mortality, as they often lead to more unintended or high-risk pregnancies among disadvantaged populations with limited access to healthcare. These pregnancies are associated with higher rates of preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications, all of which elevate infant mortality rates.

Even before Roe v. Wade was overturned, researchers highlighted the impacts of restrictive abortion laws on mortality rates. @Burdick2024 found that states with 11–12 restrictive laws during 2014–2018 had a 16% higher infant mortality rate, particularly in counties with higher proportions of Black populations, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal smoking. Similarly, @Harper2023 showed that restrictive laws are linked to higher maternal, fetal, and infant mortality, states with moderate abortion legislation had significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to restrictive states, underscoring the health benefits of less restrictive policies.





The estimand of our analysis is the change in the difference in infant death rates between states that banned abortion and states where abortion remained legal after June 24, 2022. The object of the estimation is to estimate the change in the difference in the infant death rate between the treatment and control groups based on observational data in the United States using the Difference-in-Difference approach. Our aim is to identify changes in infant mortality trends over time, providing a clearer understanding of the potential impacts of abortion bans on public health outcomes.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We conduct our infant death rate observational data analysis using the R programming language
[@citeR]. Our dataset, obtained from CDC Wonder[@cdc_wonder_2024], based on data as of December 2022, provides a detailed overview of the Infant Death Rate across the USA. CDC WONDER (Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) is an online system providing public health professionals and the public with access to a wide range of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) epidemiologic data and resources. Following the guidelines outlined in @tellingstories, we analyze the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates using the Difference-in-Difference method. This approach utilizes the interaction between the legality of abortion in the mother’s state of residence and the timing of the infant’s death as the predictor variable. Additionally, we include control variables such as infant year of death, the mother’s state of residence, race, and age to account for potential confounding factors.

## Measurement
	


## Outcome variables

### Death Rate

The death rate refers to the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births in a specified population during a given time period. It serves as a key indicator of a population’s overall health and access to healthcare. Rates labeled as "Unreliable" occur when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator, as these figures do not meet the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards for reliability or precision. After cleaning the dataset, the "Unreliable" label is converted into a separate variable named reliable.

@fig-deathrate illustrates the distribution of infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) based on the available data. The majority of infant death rates cluster around lower values, with a peak observed between 5 and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants. As the death rate increases, the frequency of occurrences decreases, indicating that higher infant death rates are relatively rare. There are few instances where the rate exceeds 20 deaths per 1,000 infants, suggesting these are outliers. Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance of lower infant death rates in the dataset.



## Predictor variables

### Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction

Abortion legality (named abortion_illegal in the dataset) is a newly created variable in our dataset, which refers to the legal status of abortion within a given state. It is represented as a binary variable, where 1 indicates that abortion is illegal in the state, and 0 indicates that abortion is legal. This classification reflects the policies and laws governing abortion access in each state.

Another created variable after_injunction indicates whether the date of infants' death falls after the implementation of the abortion injunctions following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. It is coded as a binary variable, where 1 represents dates after June 2022, signifying the post-injunction period, and 0 represents dates before June 2022, indicating the pre-injunction period.

To evaluate the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates, we utilize the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method. As part of this approach, we construct an interaction term defined as the product of abortion_illegal and after_injunction. The resulting interaction term equals 1 when abortion is illegal and the time is after the injunction, and 0 otherwise. This term is included in the analysis to evaluate the joint impact of these factors on infant death rates.

@tbl-interact highlights average infant death rates (per 1,000 live births) based on abortion legality and injunction timing. States categorized as ‘1’, where abortion became illegal after the injunction, show a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 compared to 7.9 in ‘0’ states, where abortion remained legal or abortion used to be legal before the injunction. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies and their enforcement may contribute to higher infant mortality, potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies, reduced access to maternal healthcare, and exacerbated social or economic disparities.

@fig-choromap is a choropleth map visualizes the average infant death rate per 1,000 live births across U.S. states, with data categorized by color intensity. States with higher infant death rates are shown in lighter shades (yellow), while states with lower rates are represented in darker shades (purple). States with missing data are indicated in grey. The map highlights disparities in infant mortality rates, with some states, particularly in the southeastern U.S., exhibiting notably higher rates compared to others. States like Alabama and Mississippi show the highest rates, while states such as California and New York exhibit lower rates. 

### Age of Mother

The Age of Mother (age_of_mother) refers to the age group of the mother at the time of childbirth.In our observational data, age is categorized into the brackets 15–19 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, and 30–34 years in the raw data, in compliance with privacy requirements. 

@tbl-motherage displays the average infant death rate (per 1,000 live births) by the age group of mothers. It shows a clear trend: younger mothers, particularly those aged 15–19 and 20–24, have higher infant death rates (9.0 and 10.0, respectively), while older mothers in the 25–29 and 30–34 age groups have lower rates (7.4 and 6.6, respectively). This suggests that maternal age may be a factor influencing infant mortality, with younger mothers experiencing higher risks.

# Model

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from rstanarm.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

Main Focus
The main focus of this analysis is to examine the impact of abortion legality, particularly after the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, on infant mortality rates in the United States. Using a Difference-in-Differences approach, we explore how the interaction between abortion legality and the timing of the decision influences infant death rates. This analysis incorporates various predictor variables, such as the mother's state of residence, race, age, and year of the infant’s death, to account for potential confounding factors. By modeling these relationships, we aim to quantify the extent to which restrictive abortion laws affect public health outcomes, particularly infant mortality, and to provide evidence-based insights into the broader implications of such policies.

Introduction
The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, marked a pivotal shift in U.S. abortion policy, transferring the authority to regulate abortion from the federal level to individual states. This decision, stemming from the Supreme Court’s ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ended nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights. The resulting patchwork of state laws has reignited debates over reproductive rights, public health, and social equity. States that enacted restrictive abortion laws often cited protection of maternal and fetal health as justification. However, existing research highlights the unintended consequences of such restrictions, including increased maternal and infant mortality rates, especially among disadvantaged populations with limited healthcare access.

This paper investigates the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the United States, focusing on changes following the 2022 Dobbs decision. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we assess the interaction between abortion legality and the timing of the decision to understand its influence on infant health outcomes. The study utilizes observational data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database, capturing infant mortality trends across states with varying levels of abortion restrictiveness. Key predictors include the mother’s state of residence, race, age, and the year of infant death, enabling a nuanced examination of the effects of restrictive abortion laws on public health.

We found that states banning abortion after June 2022 experienced a statistically significant increase in infant mortality rates compared to states where abortion remained legal. Specifically, our analysis reveals a 0.31 increase in infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states that enacted abortion bans. These findings align with prior research indicating that restrictive abortion laws contribute to adverse maternal and infant health outcomes, particularly in counties with higher proportions of Black populations, inadequate prenatal care, and higher rates of maternal smoking. These results underscore the broader public health implications of restrictive abortion policies, which exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and adversely impact vulnerable populations.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the data sources, variables, and methodological framework used in the analysis. Section 3 details the modeling approach, including the assumptions and specifications of the DID framework. Section 4 presents the key findings, highlighting the association between abortion bans and infant mortality. Section 5 discusses the broader implications of these findings, situating them within the context of ongoing debates about public health and reproductive rights. Finally, Section 6 concludes with recommendations for future research and policy considerations.

Results

The results of our Difference-in-Differences (DID) model, presented in Table X, highlight the relationship between abortion bans and infant mortality rates. The key interaction term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1) has a positive coefficient in both models, indicating that after the abortion injunction, states where abortion became illegal experienced an increase in infant death rates compared to states where abortion remained legal. In Model 1, the interaction term shows a coefficient of 0.172, which increases to 0.266 in Model 2, suggesting a consistent relationship across specifications.

Additionally, the coefficients for after_injunction1 are negative, indicating a general decline in infant death rates over time in states regardless of abortion legality. However, abortion_illegal1 shows a positive coefficient, reflecting higher infant mortality rates in states where abortion was banned, even before the injunction.

Control variables such as the mother’s age and race also reveal important patterns. Younger maternal age groups (20–24, 25–29, and 30–34) are associated with reduced infant mortality compared to the reference group (under 20 years). However, being Black (mothers_single_raceBlack) is associated with a substantial increase in infant death rates, consistent with existing disparities in maternal and infant health outcomes.

Overall, the findings suggest that restrictive abortion policies, particularly after the Dobbs decision, are associated with higher infant mortality rates, compounding existing disparities related to maternal age and race. These results underscore the need for targeted public health interventions in states with restrictive abortion laws.

Our analysis reveals that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and subsequent abortion bans are associated with a rise in infant mortality rates in states where abortion became illegal. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we find that states enforcing abortion bans after the injunction experienced an increase of 0.266 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared to states where abortion remained legal. Additionally, we observe that maternal age and race significantly influence infant mortality, with younger maternal age groups showing lower mortality rates and Black mothers experiencing disproportionately higher rates. These findings underscore the public health implications of restrictive abortion policies, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address these disparities.

The results from our Difference-in-Differences (DID) analysis indicate that the interaction term after_injunction × abortion_illegal, which captures the joint effect of abortion bans and the post-injunction period, is associated with an increase of 0.31 infant deaths per 1,000 live births. This highlights the significant public health implications of restrictive abortion laws. Additionally, states with abortion bans (abortion_illegal) have higher infant death rates compared to those where abortion remains legal, with a coefficient of 3.368. Control variables such as maternal age show expected trends, with older maternal age groups (e.g., 25–29 and 30–34) linked to lower infant mortality rates, as reflected by the negative coefficients. These findings underscore the need to assess the broader impacts of abortion legislation on maternal and infant health outcomes.

model_formula_1 <- cbind(num_harris, sample_size - num_harris) ~ (1 | pollster) what is it doing?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This formula specifies a hierarchical logistic regression model for use in a modeling framework such as brms or lme4 in R. Here's a detailed breakdown of what it's doing:

1. cbind(num_harris, sample_size - num_harris):
This part defines the response variable in a binomial model. Instead of providing a single success proportion (like num_harris / sample_size), the formula provides both:
num_harris: the number of successes (e.g., the number of people in the poll who support Harris).
sample_size - num_harris: the number of failures (e.g., the number of people in the poll who do not support Harris).
This is a common way to handle binomial data in regression, where the outcome is represented as the counts of successes and failures.
2. ~ (1 | pollster):
This specifies a random effect for the variable pollster, which groups the data by the pollster conducting each survey.
(1 | pollster) means that the model includes a random intercept for each pollster, allowing the model to account for variations in support for Harris that may arise due to differences in polling methodologies or biases specific to each pollster.
What This Formula Does:
It models the probability of supporting Harris (successes vs. failures) using a hierarchical logistic regression:
At the group level, it accounts for variation in polling results between different pollsters.
At the individual level, it models the binomial distribution of support for Harris based on the observed counts and sample size.
Example Use Case:
This type of formula might be used to:

Estimate the average level of support for Harris while adjusting for differences in pollster biases.
Generate predictions for individual polls while accounting for variability across pollsters.

I don't want b[intercept] in my graph
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To exclude the b[Intercept] parameter from your graph, you can filter it out of the dataset used to create the plot. If you're using a Bayesian package like brms or rstanarm in R, follow these steps:

Extract the parameters from the model (e.g., posterior samples or summaries).
Filter out rows where the parameter name matches b[Intercept].
Use the filtered dataset to plot your graph.
Here’s an example of how to implement this in R:

# Extract the posterior samples (adjust for your specific model)
posterior_samples <- as.data.frame(your_model)

# Filter out the intercept parameter
posterior_samples_filtered <- posterior_samples %>%
  select(-`b[Intercept]`)

# Recreate the plot without the intercept
plot <- mcmc_areas(
  posterior_samples_filtered,
  pars = grep("^b\\[", colnames(posterior_samples_filtered), value = TRUE),
  regex_pars = TRUE
) + 
  labs(title = "Posterior Estimates Excluding Intercept") +
  theme_minimal()

# Display the plot
print(plot)
Make sure to adjust the variable names (your_model, posterior_samples, etc.) based on your specific code. If you're using stan_plot or similar functions, there are usually arguments or filtering options to exclude parameters directly. Let me know if you need help tailoring this further!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To avoid displaying intercepts such as b[(Intercept) state:Arizona] in the model summary when using stan_glmer, you can remove them by:

1. Adjusting the Random Effects Formula
The term (1 | state) in your formula introduces a random intercept for each state. If you don't want random intercepts for each state to appear in the summary, you can either:

Remove the random intercept (1 | state) entirely (not recommended if the state-specific variation is essential for your model).
Use fixed effects for the state if variability among states needs to be modeled explicitly.
Example without the random intercept:

first_model <- stan_glmer(
  formula = death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + abortion_illegal + date,
  data = analysis_data,
  family = gaussian(),
  prior = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2, autoscale = TRUE),
  prior_aux = exponential(rate = 1, autoscale = TRUE),
  seed = 853
)
2. Filtering the Output Summary
If you want to keep the random effects in the model but avoid displaying the random intercepts in the summary, you can filter the output manually or use custom functions.

Here’s how to do it in R:

# Generate the model summary
model_summary <- summary(first_model)

# Exclude random intercept terms from the summary
filtered_summary <- model_summary[!grepl("Intercept", rownames(model_summary$coefficients)), ]

# Display the filtered summary
print(filtered_summary)
3. Using modelsummary or Other Packages
If you're using the modelsummary package to format the summary:

library(modelsummary)

modelsummary(
  first_model,
  coef_omit = "Intercept|state"  # Exclude terms with 'Intercept' or 'state'
)
Explanation
The random intercept (1 | state) creates state-specific intercepts that appear as b[(Intercept) state:<state_name>] in the summary.
To avoid showing these terms, either exclude them from the model specification or filter them from the output.
If you need to retain random effects but summarize only fixed effects, let me know, and I can tailor the solution further.

The plot shows the posterior distribution of the intercept from the Bayesian regression model (second_model).

Key Points:
Estimate: The central point on the horizontal line represents the mean (or median) estimate of the intercept.
Uncertainty: The thick segment represents the 50% credible interval, while the thin line represents the 95% credible interval for the intercept.
Interpretation: The intercept captures the baseline expected outcome of the dependent variable (death_rate) when all other predictors are at their reference levels or equal to zero. In this model, the intercept has a very large magnitude, likely due to the scale of the outcome variable or model specification.
Implications:
A wide credible interval (as seen here) suggests high uncertainty in the estimate of the intercept.
This could indicate either variability in the baseline level or potential issues with the model, such as insufficient data to pin down the baseline accurately.
If the large magnitude and uncertainty of the intercept are unexpected, you may want to revisit the model specification (e.g., scaling of predictors or inclusion of state-level random effects) to ensure the model is well-calibrated.

In this research, we analyze infant mortality rates in the United States to understand the impact of abortion policies and demographic factors. The CDC's Linked Birth/Infant Death Records database provides comprehensive data, including maternal and infant characteristics, to support this study. Variables such as maternal age, race, education, birth weight, gestational age, and prenatal care are included to ensure a detailed examination of factors influencing infant health outcomes.

The data, sourced from birth and death certificates, undergoes a thorough cleaning and validation process to address inconsistencies and missing information, ensuring accuracy. Infant mortality rates are calculated per 1,000 live births, with additional indicators such as reliability labels for rates based on fewer than 20 deaths. This step is critical to ensure statistical precision and meaningful analysis.

Once cleaned, the data is stratified by maternal and infant attributes, providing insights into trends and disparities across demographic groups. Statistical models are employed to estimate associations between state-level abortion policies and infant mortality, controlling for confounders such as maternal characteristics and prenatal care access. This structured approach transforms complex datasets into actionable insights, shedding light on the health implications of varying abortion laws across the U.S.

Weight Factors: Changes Beginning with the 1995 Data Year
Beginning in 1995 data, linked file records are weighted to compensate for the <1 to 3 percent of infant death records which could not be linked to their corresponding birth certificates. Although every effort has been made to design weights which will accurately reflect the distribution of deaths by characteristics, weighting may contribute to small differences in numbers and rates by specific variables between the linked file and the vital statistics mortality files.

A weight has been added to the linked numerator file to correct in part for biases in percent of records linked by major characteristics. The number of infant deaths in the linked file are weighted to equal the sum of the linked plus unlinked infant deaths by age at death and state. The formula for computing the weights is as follows:

(number of linked infant deaths + number of unlinked infant deaths)

number of linked infant deaths
A separate weight is computed for each reporting area of residence of birth and each age at death category. Thus, weights are 1.0 for reporting areas which link all of their infant deaths. The denominator file is not weighted. Note that for years 2002 and later, the following age at death cohorts are used for constructing weights: <7 days, 7-27 days, 28 days to 1 year.
An imputation for not-stated birthweight has been added to the data set, to reduce potential bias in the computation of birthweight-specific infant mortality rates. Basically, if birthweight is not-stated and the period of gestation is known, birthweight is assigned the value from the previous record with the same period of gestation, race, sex, and plurality. Imputed values are flagged.

For more detail, and to see the percentage of records linked for each year of data, please see the methodology sections in the publications listed at Data Source Information.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The CDC’s Linked Birth/Infant Death Records introduced a weighting system in 1995 to address biases caused by unlinked infant death records, which constitute 1-3% of all infant deaths. The weights ensure that the distribution of deaths by major characteristics reflects the total number of infant deaths, including unlinked cases. Weights are calculated for each state and infant age-at-death cohort (<7 days, 7-27 days, and 28 days to 1 year) using the formula:

Weight
=
Linked deaths
+
Unlinked deaths
Linked deaths
Weight= 
Linked deaths
Linked deaths+Unlinked deaths
​
 
This adjustment means areas with complete linkages have a weight of 1.0, while areas with incomplete linkages are adjusted proportionally. Although this approach minimizes biases, slight discrepancies in rates and numbers may occur compared to vital statistics mortality files.

Additionally, an imputation method is applied to records with missing birthweight values. If the gestational period is known, missing birthweights are assigned based on similar records matching gestation, race, sex, and plurality. This reduces potential bias in calculating birthweight-specific mortality rates, with imputed values flagged for transparency. These measures enhance data accuracy and reliability for research on infant mortality trends.

Results
The model evaluates the impact of abortion legality and its interaction with the period after the injunction on infant mortality rates, alongside other demographic and temporal variables.

Key Findings:
Effect of After Injunction (after_injunction1)
The coefficient for after_injunction1 is negative across both models, with values of -0.525 and -0.940, suggesting that the period following the injunction is associated with a slight decrease in infant mortality rates. However, this effect is not substantial enough to stand independently without further interaction terms.

Impact of Abortion Legality (abortion_illegal1)
States where abortion is illegal demonstrate an increased infant mortality rate, with coefficients of 3.365 and 1.400 across models. This indicates that restrictive abortion laws are linked to higher infant mortality rates, aligning with prior findings that such policies exacerbate adverse health outcomes for infants.

Interaction Term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1)
The interaction term combining abortion legality and the post-injunction period is significant, with coefficients of 0.111 and 0.280. These results suggest that the combined effect of restrictive abortion laws implemented after the injunction results in an additional increase in infant mortality rates. This highlights the compounded adverse effects of restrictive policies enacted in the aftermath of the injunction.

Year of Death (year_of_death)
The coefficient for year_of_death is positive (0.33 in Model 2), indicating a slight increase in infant mortality rates over time, independent of abortion policies. This could reflect broader trends in healthcare access or other systemic factors influencing infant health outcomes.

Effect of Maternal Age
The age groups of mothers demonstrate a clear pattern:

Mothers aged 20–24 years have a negative coefficient (-3.57 in Model 2), indicating lower infant mortality rates compared to younger mothers.
Mothers aged 25–29 years and 30–34 years show progressively lower coefficients (-5.73 and -6.15, respectively), underscoring the protective effects of older maternal age on infant mortality rates. These findings highlight the importance of maternal age as a critical factor in infant health outcomes.
Maternal Race (Black)
The coefficient for Black mothers is 6.66 in Model 2, showing significantly higher infant mortality rates for this demographic group compared to others. This finding underscores the persistent racial disparities in health outcomes, likely driven by systemic inequities in healthcare access, socioeconomic conditions, and prenatal care.

Interpretation:
The results indicate that abortion bans enacted after the overturning of Roe v. Wade are associated with a measurable increase in infant mortality rates, particularly in states where abortion became illegal. This effect is compounded in the post-injunction period, highlighting the intersection of policy changes and adverse health outcomes. Additionally, demographic variables such as maternal age and race reveal significant disparities in infant mortality, necessitating targeted interventions to address these issues.

These findings underscore the broader public health implications of restrictive abortion policies, emphasizing the need for equitable healthcare access and policy reform to mitigate the adverse effects on vulnerable populations.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The analysis reveals critical insights into the impact of abortion policies and demographic factors on infant mortality rates in the United States, with a particular focus on the interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, the model shows a significant positive interaction term (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating that the combination of abortion bans and the period following the June 2022 Dobbs decision contributes to an increase in infant mortality rates. This interaction highlights the compounded effect of restrictive abortion policies on public health outcomes, with states enforcing abortion bans after the injunction experiencing higher infant death rates compared to states where abortion remained legal.

Furthermore, the results underscore the independent effects of abortion legality and the post-injunction period. States with abortion bans demonstrate significantly higher infant mortality rates (coefficients of 3.365 and 1.400 across models), while the post-injunction period alone is associated with a decrease in mortality rates (-0.525 and -0.940), likely reflecting broader temporal trends in healthcare or other confounders. The interaction term, however, suggests that the conjunction of these two factors disproportionately affects infant health outcomes, intensifying adverse effects.

The analysis also reveals notable disparities based on maternal demographics. Maternal age is inversely associated with infant mortality, with older age groups (25–29 and 30–34 years) experiencing lower rates (-5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively), while younger mothers face elevated risks. Additionally, the results point to significant racial disparities, with Black mothers experiencing substantially higher infant mortality rates (coefficient of 6.66), emphasizing the need to address systemic inequities in healthcare access and quality.

These findings collectively highlight the intersection of policy and demographic factors in shaping infant health outcomes. The significant DID interaction term underscores the critical role of abortion policy changes in exacerbating infant mortality, particularly in states with pre-existing bans. This analysis not only provides evidence of the public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies but also points to the urgent need for targeted interventions to mitigate these impacts and address disparities across racial and demographic groups.

Public Health Implications of Abortion Bans
The observed increase in infant mortality rates in states where abortion became illegal following the Dobbs decision underscores the broader public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies. These findings highlight the potential strain on healthcare systems in these states, as higher infant mortality often correlates with inadequate access to prenatal care and systemic inequities in maternal and infant health services. Addressing these gaps is essential to mitigate the unintended consequences of restrictive legislation.

Racial Disparities Amplified by Policy Changes
The disproportionate impact on Black mothers, who experience significantly higher infant mortality rates, raises critical questions about the intersection of race, policy, and healthcare access. Restrictive abortion laws may disproportionately affect communities already marginalized by socioeconomic and systemic healthcare inequities, further exacerbating health disparities. These results call for targeted policy interventions that prioritize equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare across racial and economic lines.

Broader Impacts on Maternal and Infant Health
Beyond infant mortality, the results suggest a broader trend where restrictive abortion laws could contribute to poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. The interaction term, capturing the compounded effect of post-injunction abortion bans, points to systemic barriers that may lead to more high-risk pregnancies and insufficient healthcare interventions. These findings underscore the importance of integrating reproductive rights into broader public health strategies to address both immediate and long-term health disparities.

What is done in this paper?
This paper investigates the impact of abortion bans, particularly following the Dobbs decision of 2022, on infant mortality rates in the United States. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology, it analyzes trends in infant mortality across states where abortion became illegal versus those where it remained legal. By including demographic and maternal factors such as age, race, and prenatal care access, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of how restrictive abortion laws influence infant health outcomes.

What is something that we learn about the world?
The findings reveal that states enforcing abortion bans after the injunction experienced an increase in infant mortality rates, with an additional 0.28 deaths per 1,000 live births. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies are associated with higher risks for infants, potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies and reduced access to maternal healthcare. The study highlights how policy changes can have unintended, far-reaching health consequences.

What is another thing that we learn about the world?
Racial disparities in infant mortality are exacerbated by restrictive abortion policies. Black mothers, already facing significantly higher rates of infant mortality compared to other racial groups, may be disproportionately affected by these laws. This emphasizes the intersectionality of race, socioeconomic status, and healthcare access in understanding the broader impacts of public policy.

What are some weaknesses of what was done?
While the DID approach effectively estimates the causal impact of abortion bans, the study is limited by its reliance on observational data, which may be affected by unmeasured confounders. Additionally, the analysis focuses on aggregate state-level trends, which could mask regional or within-state disparities. The inability to fully account for all possible socio-political and economic factors influencing infant mortality may introduce bias into the estimates.

What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?
Future research should examine the long-term impacts of abortion bans on maternal and infant health outcomes, incorporating a broader time frame and more granular data. Investigating regional disparities within states and the role of healthcare infrastructure in mitigating the effects of restrictive policies would provide deeper insights. Additionally, qualitative research exploring the lived experiences of affected populations could complement quantitative findings, offering a more holistic understanding of the consequences of abortion bans.

The results also underscore persistent racial disparities in infant mortality. Black mothers experience significantly higher infant mortality rates compared to other racial groups, and these disparities may be exacerbated by restrictive abortion laws. This points to broader systemic inequities in healthcare access and outcomes, particularly for marginalized communities.

What are some weaknesses of what was done?
While the DID methodology provides robust causal estimates, the study is constrained by its reliance on observational data, which may leave some confounding factors unaccounted for. Additionally, the use of aggregate state-level data may obscure intra-state variations and regional disparities in the impact of abortion bans. Moreover, the analysis does not account for broader socio-economic factors, such as Medicaid expansion or access to family planning services, which may influence infant mortality independently of abortion laws.

What is left to learn or how should we proceed in the future?
Future research should explore the long-term health impacts of abortion bans on both infants and mothers, incorporating a wider time frame and more detailed geographic data. Investigating within-state differences and the role of healthcare infrastructure in mitigating or exacerbating these impacts could provide further insight. Additionally, qualitative studies could complement quantitative findings by shedding light on the lived experiences of those affected by these policies. Policymakers should consider these results when evaluating the public health consequences of restrictive abortion laws and prioritize interventions that address healthcare inequities.

# Introduction

The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, through the Supreme
Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ended
nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights.
This landmark ruling shifted authority over abortion regulations to
individual states, creating a patchwork of laws nationwide. The decision
reignited debates about reproductive rights and public health,
highlighting disparities in access to abortion services and their
effects on health outcomes, especially in states with restrictive
policies.

Banning abortion usually has been linked to a rise in maternal mortality
rates, with Texas experiencing a 56% increase from 2019 to 2022
[@nbcnews]. However, restrictive abortion laws can also impact infant
mortality, as they often lead to more unintended or high-risk
pregnancies among disadvantaged populations with limited access to
healthcare. These pregnancies are associated with higher rates of
preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications, all of
which elevate infant mortality rates. Even before Roe v. Wade was
overturned, researchers highlighted the impacts of restrictive abortion
laws on mortality rates. @Burdick2024 found that states with 11–12
restrictive laws during 2014–2018 had a 16% higher infant mortality
rate, particularly in counties with higher proportions of Black
populations, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal smoking. Similarly,
@Harper2023 showed that restrictive laws are linked to higher maternal,
fetal, and infant mortality, states with moderate abortion legislation
had significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live
births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to
restrictive states, underscoring the health benefits of less restrictive
policies.

The estimand of our analysis is the change in the difference in infant
death rates between states that banned abortion and states where
abortion remained legal after June 24, 2022. The object of the
estimation is to estimate the change in the difference in the infant
death rate between the treatment and control groups based on
observational data in the United States.

Instead of examining the impact of abortion laws over broader time
periods like prior research, our study focuses on the effect of abortion
bans on infant mortality rates in the United States specifically from
2021 to 2022, with an emphasis on changes following the 2022 Dobbs
decision. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we assess
the interaction between abortion legality in states and the timing of
the injunction implemented to understand its influence on infant health
outcomes. The study utilizes observational data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database, capturing infant
mortality trends across states with varying levels of abortion
restrictiveness. Key predictors include the mother’s state of residence,
race, age, and the year of infant death, enabling a nuanced examination
of the effects of restrictive abortion laws on public health.

Our Results show that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the
implementation of abortion bans are linked to a rise in infant mortality
rates in states where abortion became illegal. Through a
Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we estimate that states
enforcing abortion bans after the injunction saw an increase of 0.285
deaths per 1,000 live births compared to states where abortion remained
legal. Furthermore, we find that maternal age and race are key
determinants of infant mortality, with older maternal age groups
associated with lower mortality rates and Black mothers experiencing
significantly higher rates. These results emphasize the public health
consequences of restrictive abortion laws and the urgent need for
policies that mitigate these disparities.

This study is important as we highlight the public health implications
of abortion bans, particularly their role in increasing infant mortality
rates. By focusing on the 2022 Dobbs decision, we provide timely
evidence on how restrictive abortion policies disproportionately affect
vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for data-driven policies to
mitigate these adverse outcomes.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We conduct our infant death rate observational data analysis using the R
programming language [@citeR]. Our dataset, obtained from CDC
Wonder[@cdc_wonder_2024], based on data as of December 2022, provides a
detailed overview of the Infant Death Rate across the USA. CDC WONDER
(Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) is an online
system providing public health professionals and the public with access
to a wide range of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
epidemiologic data and resources. Following the guidelines outlined in
@tellingstories, we analyze the impact of abortion injunctions on infant
death rates using the Difference-in-Difference method. This approach
utilizes the interaction between the legality of abortion in the
mother’s state of residence and the timing of the infant’s death as the
predictor variable. Additionally, we include control variables such as
infant year of death, the mother’s state of residence, race, and age to
account for potential confounding factors.

## Measurement

The process of translating real-world events into our dataset requires a
systematic approach to measurement and data gathering. In this research,
we analyze infant mortality rates in the United States to understand the
impact of abortion policies and demographic factors. The CDC’s Linked
Birth/Infant Death Records database provides comprehensive data,
including maternal and infant characteristics, to support this study.
Variables such as maternal age, race, education, birth weight,
gestational age, and prenatal care are included to ensure a detailed
examination of factors influencing infant health outcomes.

The data, sourced from birth and death certificates, undergoes a
thorough cleaning and validation process to address inconsistencies and
missing information, ensuring accuracy. Infant mortality rates are
calculated per 1,000 live births, with additional indicators such as
reliability labels for rates based on fewer than 20 deaths. To further
enhance data accuracy, weights are applied to adjust for unlinked infant
death records, ensuring that all deaths—linked and unlinked—are
proportionally represented. Weights are calculated for each state and
infant age-at-death cohort (\<7 days, 7-27 days, and 28 days to 1 year)
using the formula:
$\text{Weight} = \frac{\text{Linked deaths} + \text{Unlinked deaths}}{\text{Linked deaths}}$
This adjustment means areas with complete linkages have a weight of 1.0,
while areas with incomplete linkages are adjusted proportionally.
Additionally, imputation techniques are employed to handle missing
birthweight data, assigning values based on gestational period, race,
sex, and plurality, further reducing potential bias in the analysis.

Once cleaned, the data is stratified by maternal and infant attributes,
providing insights into trends and disparities across demographic
groups. Statistical models are employed to estimate associations between
state-level abortion policies and infant mortality, controlling for
confounders such as maternal characteristics. This structured approach
transforms complex datasets into actionable insights, shedding light on
the health implications of varying abortion laws across the U.S. By
leveraging comprehensive datasets and robust statistical techniques,
this study offers a nuanced understanding of the intersection between
policy, demographics, and infant health outcomes, informing public
health strategies and legislative decisions.

## Outcome variables

### Death Rate

The death rate refers to the number of deaths of infants under one
year of age per 1,000 live births in a specified population during a
given time period. It serves as a key indicator of a population’s
overall health and access to healthcare. Rates labeled as "Unreliable"
occur when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator, as these
figures do not meet the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
standards for reliability or precision. After cleaning the dataset, the
"Unreliable" label is converted into a separate variable named
reliable.

@fig-deathrate illustrates the distribution of infant death rates (per
1,000 live births) based on the available data. The majority of infant
death rates cluster around lower values, with a peak observed between 5
and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants. As the death rate increases, the
frequency of occurrences decreases, indicating that higher infant death
rates are relatively rare. There are few instances where the rate
exceeds 20 deaths per 1,000 infants, suggesting these are outliers.
Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance
of lower infant death rates in the dataset.

## Predictor variables

### Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction

Abortion legality (named abortion_illegal in the dataset) is a newly
created variable in our dataset, which refers to the legal status of
abortion within a given state. It is represented as a binary variable,
where 1 indicates that abortion is illegal in the state, and 0 indicates
that abortion is legal. This classification reflects the policies and
laws governing abortion access in each state.

Another created variable after_injunction indicates whether the date
of infants' death falls after the implementation of the abortion
injunctions following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. It is
coded as a binary variable, where 1 represents dates after June 2022,
signifying the post-injunction period, and 0 represents dates before
June 2022, indicating the pre-injunction period.

To evaluate the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates, we
utilize the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method. As part of this
approach, we construct an interaction term defined as the product of
abortion_illegal and after_injunction. The resulting interaction
term equals 1 when abortion is illegal and the time is after the
injunction, and 0 otherwise. This term is included in the analysis to
evaluate the joint impact of these factors on infant death rates.

@tbl-interact highlights average infant death rates (per 1,000 live
births) based on abortion legality and injunction timing. States
categorized as ‘1’, where abortion became illegal after the injunction,
show a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 compared to 7.9 in ‘0’
states, where abortion remained legal or abortion used to be legal
before the injunction. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies
and their enforcement may contribute to higher infant mortality,
potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies,
reduced access to maternal healthcare, and exacerbated social or
economic disparities.

## Control Variables

### Year of Death

The Year of Death variable represents the calendar year in which the
infant death occurred, specifically focusing on the years 2021 and 2022
in this study. This variable is essential for analyzing temporal trends
and identifying patterns or shifts in infant mortality rates over this
critical period. By controlling the year of death, we can closely
examine the impact of significant policy changes, such as the
overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, as well as other temporal factors on
infant health outcomes.

### State

The state of the mother’s legal residence at the time of birth. This
data is categorized by the mother’s state of residence and excludes
territories.

grey. The map highlights disparities in infant mortality rates, with
some states, particularly in the southeastern U.S., exhibiting notably
higher rates compared to others. States like Alabama and Mississippi
show the highest rates, while states such as California and New York
exhibit lower rates.

### Age of Mother

The Age of Mother (age_of_mother) refers to the age group of the
mother at the time of childbirth.In our observational data, age is
categorized into the brackets 15–19 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, and
30–34 years in the raw data, in compliance with privacy requirements.

@tbl-motherage displays the average infant death rate (per 1,000 live
births) by the age group of mothers. It shows a clear trend: younger
mothers, particularly those aged 15–19 and 20–24, have higher infant
death rates (9.0 and 10.0, respectively), while older mothers in the
25–29 and 30–34 age groups have lower rates (7.4 and 6.6, respectively).
This suggests that maternal age may be a factor influencing infant
mortality, with younger mothers experiencing higher risks.

# Model

For our analysis, we use a Bayesian Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to quantify the impact of abortion injunctions on the infant death rate across states in the USA. This method compares changes in infant death rates over time between a treatment group (states where abortion injunctions were implemented) and a control group (states where abortion remains legal), providing a robust framework for estimating causal effects.

## Difference-In-Difference Approach (DID)

Difference-in-Differences (DID) is a causal inference method that estimates the impact of an intervention by comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. By assuming parallel trends in the absence of the intervention, the DID framework isolates the intervention’s effect through **the interaction between time periods (pre- and post-intervention) and group membership**. This makes it a robust method for evaluating policy changes and other significant events.

### Assumption

The validity of the Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach in our study relies on several key assumptions, which, if violated, could affect the robustness and reliability of our results [@cunningham2021]:

#### Parallel Trends Assumption

The model relies on the assumption that, without the abortion injunction, the treatment group (states where abortion became illegal) and the control group (states where abortion remained legal) would have followed similar trends in infant mortality rates. However, this assumption can be challenged by differences in healthcare systems, socioeconomic conditions, or pre-existing policy environments, which may cause deviations from parallel trends.

#### Compositional Differences

In addition to parallel trends, compositional changes in repeated cross-sectional data over time can influence results. For instance, shifts in demographic factors such as maternal age or racial makeup between pre- and post-intervention periods may confound the observed changes in infant mortality rates. Including control variables helps adjust for these confounders, ensuring that the estimated effect reflects the policy intervention rather than changes in population composition.

#### Long-term Effects vs. Reliability

The length of the analysis period further complicates the reliability of results. While longer periods allow for capturing long-term effects, they also increase the likelihood of unrelated factors, such as new policies or healthcare advancements, influencing the outcome. Over time, some states in the control group may also implement similar abortion policies, diluting the treatment effect. Conversely, shorter analysis periods 

#### Functional Form Dependence

Finally, the model assumes that the functional relationship between predictors and outcomes is correctly specified. If this assumption is violated, differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups may stem from misspecified relationships rather than the intervention itself. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing the model’s structure and assumptions to ensure valid results.

## Model Parameters
The model focuses on the infant death rate per 1,000 live births as the dependent variable and includes the following independent variables:

- **Treatment Group Indicator abortion_illegal**: A binary variable indicating the group: 1 if abortion is illegal in the state. 0 if abortion remains legal.

-	**Time Indicator after_injunction**: A binary variable indicating the time period: 0 for the period before the injunction implemented. 1 for the period after the injunction implemented.

-	**Interaction Termafter_injunction × abortion_illegal**: The interaction term captures the additional change in the outcome (e.g., percentage of support, behavior, or health-related metrics) for regions where abortion is illegal after the injunction implemented, beyond any changes observed in regions where abortion remains legal.

Additionally, we include these control variables to adjust for demographic and temporal factors that could influence infant mortality rates, ensuring that the estimated effects are not confounded by these characteristics:

- **age_of_mother**: The age of the mother at the time of birth, represented as a continuous variable.

- **mothers_single_race**: Self-identified race of the mother, represented as a categorical variable.

- **year_of_death**:  The year in which the infant death occurred, represented as a continuous variable.

Finally, we include a random variable:

- **state**: Mother's residence state when the infant born as a random effect in the model. 

By isolating the impact of the abortion injunction through this interaction term after_injunction×abortion_illegal, our model identifies changes in infant death rates that can be attributed to the policy intervention. Additional details and diagnostics supporting the model’s implementation are provided in [Appendix-@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

In our analysis, we employ two models. The first model includes only the predictor variables and the random effect for state. The second model builds on the first by incorporating additional control variables to account for potential confounding factors.

Define $y_i$ as as the infant death rate per 1,000 live births, and $\gamma_j$ as the random state effect.

\beta_6 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\gamma_j&\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_j^2)\\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{aligned}
$$

The models are run in R (R Core Team 2023) using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. The default priors from rstanarm are used for both GLM Bayesian models. We run the model in R [@citeR] using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from rstanarm used for both Gaussian Bayesian models.

### Model justification

For our analysis, we use separate Bayesian regression models to estimate the infant death rates in states where abortion injunctions were implemented and in states where abortion remains legal. We use the interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal to measure the causal effect of the abortion injunction. Both models share the same predictors to ensure consistency and comparability in capturing the determinants of infant mortality.

For one of our models, we include control variables (age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, and year_of_death) to adjust for confounders that could influence infant death rates, addressing the assumption of compositional differences in the DID approach and ensuring unbiased estimates of the intervention’s effect. In the other model, we exclude these controls to focus on the overall intervention impact, avoid overfitting, and prioritize simplicity when variability is adequately accounted for by the design or random effects. Thus, our decision to fit two models is to compare the outcomes: one adjusts for confounders to refine the estimates, while the other focuses on the direct effect of the intervention.

Our model includes state as a random effect to account for regional variations in infant mortality that could introduce bias. We use a random effect rather than a fixed effect to capture variability across states without estimating specific effects for each one. This approach models unobserved heterogeneity, such as differences in healthcare systems and socioeconomic conditions, using a single variance term, which avoids overfitting and ensures efficiency and generalizability. By adjusting for unmeasured state-specific factors, the model provides robust and reliable findings while balancing parsimony and interpretability, making it well-suited for our analysis.

We choose the Bayesian framework since it enhances the DID approach by incorporating prior information and quantifying uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. In our Bayesian models, we use weakly informative priors from the rstanarm package, including a Normal prior ($\mu=0$ and $\sigma=2.5$) for fixed effects and an Exponential prior (rate = 1) for the auxiliary parameter, with autoscale=TRUE to dynamically adjust priors based on data scale. This enhances convergence and ensures priors are calibrated to predictor ranges without dominating the data. The model assumes plausible parameter centering, random effects capture unobserved heterogeneity, and the DID framework relies on parallel trends between groups. However, limitations include potential bias from misspecified priors, computational challenges for hierarchical models, and sensitivity to data sparsity or imbalances. This model may not be suitable if group-level effects are negligible, parallel trends are violated, or data is insufficient, but when applied appropriately, it provides robust and interpretable causal estimates.

Our results from the two models are summarized in @tbl-modelresults, highlighting key predictors and their estimated effects on infant mortality rates.

The analysis reveals critical insights into the impact of abortion policies and demographic factors on infant mortality rates in the United States, with a particular focus on the interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period.  The model shows a significant positive interaction term (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating that the combination of abortion bans and the period following the June 2022 Dobbs decision contributes to an increase in infant mortality rates. This interaction highlights the compounded effect of restrictive abortion policies on public health outcomes, with states enforcing abortion bans after the injunction experiencing higher infant death rates compared to states where abortion remained legal.

Furthermore, the results underscore the independent effects of abortion legality and the post-injunction period. States with abortion bans demonstrate significantly higher infant mortality rates (coefficients of 3.365 and 1.400 across models), while the post-injunction period alone is associated with a decrease in mortality rates (-0.525 and -0.940), likely reflecting broader temporal trends in healthcare or other confounders. The interaction term, however, suggests that the conjunction of these two factors disproportionately affects infant health outcomes, intensifying adverse effects.

The analysis also reveals notable disparities based on maternal demographics. Maternal age is inversely associated with infant mortality, with older age groups (25–29 and 30–34 years) experiencing lower rates (-5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively), while younger mothers face elevated risks. Additionally, the results point to significant racial disparities, with Black mothers experiencing substantially higher infant mortality rates (coefficient of 6.66), emphasizing the need to address systemic inequities in healthcare access and quality.

These findings collectively highlight the intersection of policy and demographic factors in shaping infant health outcomes. The significant DID interaction term underscores the critical role of abortion policy changes in exacerbating infant mortality, particularly in states with pre-existing bans. This analysis not only provides evidence of the public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies but also points to the urgent need for targeted interventions to mitigate these impacts and address disparities across racial and demographic groups.

The model’s performance is supported by its metrics, with a low RMSE indicating accurate predictions and a high R² demonstrating that a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates is explained by the predictors. These results confirm the model’s robustness in capturing the effects of abortion policy changes and demographic factors on infant mortality.

## Weaknesses and next steps

Weaknesses and next steps should also be included.
## Public Health Implications of Abortion Bans
The observed increase in infant mortality rates in states where abortion became illegal following the Dobbs decision underscores the broader public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies. These findings highlight the potential strain on healthcare systems in these states, as higher infant mortality often correlates with inadequate access to prenatal care and systemic inequities in maternal and infant health services. Addressing these gaps is essential to mitigate the unintended consequences of restrictive legislation.
## Racial Disparities Amplified by Policy Changes
The disproportionate impact on Black mothers, who experience significantly higher infant mortality rates, raises critical questions about the intersection of race, policy, and healthcare access. Restrictive abortion laws may disproportionately affect communities already marginalized by socioeconomic and systemic healthcare inequities, further exacerbating health disparities. These results call for targeted policy interventions that prioritize equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare across racial and economic lines.
## Broader Impacts on Maternal and Infant Health
Beyond infant mortality, the results suggest a broader trend where restrictive abortion laws could contribute to poorer maternal and infant health outcomes. The interaction term, capturing the compounded effect of post-injunction abortion bans, points to systemic barriers that may lead to more high-risk pregnancies and insufficient healthcare interventions. These findings underscore the importance of integrating reproductive rights into broader public health strategies to address both immediate and long-term health disparities.

Public Health Implications of Restrictive Abortion Laws
This study underscores the significant public health impacts of abortion bans in the United States. The observed increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states implementing abortion bans after the Dobbs decision highlights how restrictive abortion policies exacerbate health disparities. These results align with broader public health concerns, as higher infant mortality rates often indicate gaps in prenatal care, healthcare access, and socioeconomic equity. Addressing these systemic issues is critical to mitigating the unintended consequences of such legislation, particularly in states with pre-existing healthcare challenges.

Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities
The analysis reveals stark racial disparities, with Black mothers experiencing disproportionately higher infant mortality rates compared to other racial groups. These disparities are compounded by restrictive abortion laws, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The intersection of systemic healthcare inequities, socioeconomic challenges, and restrictive legislation amplifies health risks for marginalized communities. Future policy interventions must prioritize equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare to address these disparities and prevent further exacerbation of health inequities.

Policy and Healthcare Systems Integration
The findings also suggest broader implications for maternal and infant health outcomes under restrictive abortion policies. The significant interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period illustrates how these policies influence infant mortality rates. This compounded effect highlights the need for integrated healthcare systems that can address high-risk pregnancies, improve prenatal care, and ensure equitable access to healthcare services. Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of abortion bans on public health and invest in strategies that safeguard maternal and infant health, particularly in regions most affected by restrictive legislation.

Limitations and Future Research
While this study provides critical insights, there are limitations to consider. The analysis relies on aggregate state-level data, which may not capture intra-state disparities or localized effects of abortion laws. Additionally, unmeasured confounders, such as economic conditions or healthcare system differences, may influence the results. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of abortion policies, integrate more granular data, and include qualitative studies to better understand the lived experiences of affected populations. These efforts can inform evidence-based policies that promote equitable health outcomes and mitigate the adverse effects of restrictive abortion laws.

A key limitation of this study is the availability of data, which only spans from 2021 to 2022. While this timeframe allows us to assess immediate changes in infant mortality rates following the Dobbs decision, it does not capture the full one-year outcomes for infants born after the policy shift. As a result, the analysis may miss longer-term trends and delayed effects of abortion bans on infant mortality, potentially underestimating the true impact of these policy changes. Access to extended datasets in future research will be critical for a more comprehensive understanding of these effects.

Limitation in Infant Mortality Coverage
The dataset used in this study provides counts and rates for deaths of infants under 1 year of age occurring within the United States to U.S. residents. While this focus ensures a specific and detailed examination of infant mortality, it excludes cases where deaths occur after the infant's first birthday or outside U.S. jurisdictions. This limitation means that some infant deaths, particularly those involving unique circumstances or delayed health complications, may not be captured, potentially underrepresenting the broader impact of abortion policy changes on early childhood mortality.

Discussion
Public Health Implications of Abortion Bans
The observed increase in infant mortality rates in states enforcing abortion bans following the Dobbs decision underscores the broader public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies. By creating barriers to safe and legal abortion services, these laws may lead to higher rates of unintended or high-risk pregnancies, often among individuals with limited access to healthcare. Such pregnancies are associated with adverse outcomes, including preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications, which contribute to elevated infant mortality rates. These findings highlight the urgent need to address healthcare disparities in states with restrictive policies, as well as the importance of ensuring equitable access to reproductive and maternal healthcare services.

Systemic Inequities and Racial Disparities
Our analysis also points to systemic inequities that are exacerbated by restrictive abortion laws, particularly among Black mothers who face disproportionately higher rates of infant mortality. These disparities likely stem from a combination of socioeconomic disadvantages, systemic biases in healthcare systems, and reduced access to quality prenatal and postnatal care. Restrictive abortion policies may compound these challenges by disproportionately impacting communities already marginalized by structural inequities. Addressing these disparities requires targeted policy interventions and investments in community-based healthcare initiatives that prioritize equitable care for vulnerable populations.

Broader Impacts on Maternal and Child Health
The results of this study suggest broader implications for maternal and child health beyond infant mortality rates. Restrictive abortion laws may lead to increased maternal health complications, placing further strain on healthcare systems and caregivers in affected states. Additionally, the burden on families dealing with high-risk pregnancies and adverse outcomes may contribute to long-term economic and emotional stress. These findings call for a holistic approach to reproductive health policy, one that integrates abortion access with broader maternal and child health initiatives to mitigate these effects and support overall family well-being.

Temporal and Data Constraints
While this study provides valuable insights, its scope is limited by the temporal constraints of the dataset, which only includes infant deaths under 1 year of age during 2021–2022. The absence of data for infants who died in 2023 or later limits our ability to fully assess the longer-term impacts of the Dobbs decision. Furthermore, excluding infants over 1 year of age or those outside the U.S. may result in an incomplete understanding of the broader public health implications. Future research should incorporate more comprehensive datasets spanning extended time periods to capture the full spectrum of these impacts.

Policy and Research Implications
The findings of this study emphasize the need for policy interventions that address the unintended consequences of restrictive abortion laws. Policymakers should consider the broader public health implications of such legislation, particularly for marginalized communities, and invest in healthcare infrastructure that supports maternal and infant health. Future research should also explore the intersection of reproductive health policies with socioeconomic and healthcare factors, using longitudinal data to assess both short-term and long-term outcomes. By doing so, we can better inform evidence-based policies that prioritize the health and well-being of all individuals, regardless of geographic or demographic disparities.

ChatGPT
Interpreting the Model Coefficients
The table summarizes two models estimating the impact of various factors on infant mortality rates (per 1,000 live births). Below is the interpretation of each coefficient:

(Intercept):
Model (1): The intercept (9.850) represents the baseline infant mortality rate when all predictor variables are set to their reference levels (e.g., before the injunction, abortion is legal, maternal age is 15–19, and maternal race is Asian).
Model (2): The intercept (-650.64) is not interpretable in isolation due to the inclusion of continuous variables (e.g., year_of_death) and control variables, which adjust the baseline reference.
after_injunction1 (Post-Injunction Period):
Model (1): A coefficient of -0.525 suggests that infant mortality rates decreased by 0.525 deaths per 1,000 live births during the post-injunction period compared to the pre-injunction period, assuming abortion remained legal.
Model (2): A coefficient of -0.940 similarly indicates a reduction in infant mortality rates during the post-injunction period, controlling for additional demographic variables.
abortion_illegal1 (Abortion Bans):
Model (1): A coefficient of 3.365 indicates that states with abortion bans experienced a 3.365 higher infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births) compared to states where abortion remained legal, regardless of the injunction timing.
Model (2): A coefficient of 1.400 shows a smaller but still positive association between abortion bans and increased infant mortality rates after adjusting for demographic variables.
after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1 (DID Interaction Term):
Model (1): The interaction term (0.111) indicates that states with abortion bans during the post-injunction period experienced an additional increase of 0.111 infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to the combined baseline.
Model (2): The coefficient of 0.280 suggests a stronger combined effect after adjusting for demographic factors, reflecting the compounded impact of abortion bans and the post-injunction period on infant mortality.
year_of_death:
Model (2) Only: A coefficient of 0.330 suggests that for each additional year (e.g., moving from 2021 to 2022), infant mortality rates increased by 0.330 deaths per 1,000 live births, potentially reflecting temporal trends or external factors.
age_of_mother (Maternal Age Groups):
Coefficients are relative to the reference category (mothers aged 15–19 years):
20–24 years:
Model (1): -3.570 indicates that mothers aged 20–24 have 3.570 fewer infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to mothers aged 15–19.
Model (2): -3.570 remains consistent after adjusting for additional variables.
25–29 years:
Model (1): -5.730 suggests a greater reduction in infant mortality rates for mothers aged 25–29 compared to the youngest age group.
Model (2): -5.730 remains consistent.
30–34 years:
Model (1): -6.150 indicates that mothers in this age group have the lowest infant mortality rates compared to mothers aged 15–19.
Model (2): -6.150 remains unchanged.
mothers_single_raceBlack (Black Mothers):
Model (2) Only: A coefficient of 6.660 indicates that Black mothers experience 6.660 more infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to the reference category (Asian mothers), highlighting significant racial disparities in infant mortality.
Key Takeaways:
Post-Injunction Period: Both models show a decrease in infant mortality rates during the post-injunction period in states without abortion bans, suggesting broader temporal factors.
Abortion Bans: The presence of abortion bans is consistently associated with higher infant mortality rates, emphasizing the public health implications of restrictive policies.
DID Interaction Term: The positive interaction term underscores the compounded effect of abortion bans implemented during the post-injunction period.
Maternal Age and Race: Older maternal age groups are associated with lower infant mortality, while Black mothers experience significantly higher rates, revealing disparities in health outcomes across demographics.

The results from the two models provide critical insights into the factors influencing infant mortality rates. The post-injunction period (after_injunction1) is associated with a decrease in infant mortality rates, with reductions of 0.525 and 0.940 deaths per 1,000 live births in Models 1 and 2, respectively, in states where abortion remained legal. However, states with abortion bans (abortion_illegal1) show significantly higher infant mortality rates, with an increase of 3.365 deaths in Model 1 and 1.400 deaths in Model 2, highlighting the detrimental public health impact of restrictive abortion policies. The Difference-in-Differences (DID) interaction term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1) reveals a compounding effect, where abortion bans during the post-injunction period lead to an additional increase of 0.111 deaths in Model 1 and 0.280 deaths in Model 2, further emphasizing the combined adverse impact of these policies and the timing of their implementation. Maternal age and race also emerge as significant predictors; older maternal age groups (25–34 years) are associated with substantially lower infant mortality rates compared to younger mothers (15–19 years), while Black mothers experience significantly higher rates (6.660 more deaths per 1,000 live births compared to Asian mothers), underscoring profound racial disparities in infant health outcomes. These findings collectively highlight the interplay between policy, demographics, and infant mortality, underscoring the urgent need for targeted interventions to address systemic inequities.

The results from the two models highlight important factors influencing infant mortality rates. The post-injunction period (after_injunction1) is linked to a reduction in infant mortality rates, with decreases of 0.525 and 0.940 deaths per 1,000 live births in Models 1 and 2, respectively, in states where abortion remained legal. In contrast, states where abortion became illegal (abortion_illegal1) show higher infant mortality rates, with increases of 3.365 deaths in Model 1 and 1.400 deaths in Model 2, pointing to the negative effects of restrictive abortion laws.

Our results from the two models are summarized in @tbl-modelresults, highlighting key predictors and their estimated effects on infant mortality rates.

The analysis reveals critical insights into the impact of abortion policies and demographic factors on infant mortality rates in the United States, with a particular focus on the interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period. The model shows a significant positive interaction term (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating that the combination of abortion bans and the period following the June 2022 Dobbs decision contributes to an increase in infant mortality rates. This interaction highlights the compounded effect of restrictive abortion policies on public health outcomes, with states enforcing abortion bans after the injunction experiencing higher infant death rates compared to states where abortion remained legal.

Furthermore, the results underscore the independent effects of abortion legality and the post-injunction period. States with abortion bans demonstrate significantly higher infant mortality rates (coefficients of 3.365 and 1.400 across models), while the post-injunction period alone is associated with a decrease in mortality rates (-0.525 and -0.940), likely reflecting broader temporal trends in healthcare or other confounders. The interaction term, however, suggests that the conjunction of these two factors disproportionately affects infant health outcomes, intensifying adverse effects.

The analysis also reveals notable disparities based on maternal demographics. Maternal age is inversely associated with infant mortality, with older age groups (25–29 and 30–34 years) experiencing lower rates (-5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively), while younger mothers face elevated risks. Additionally, the results point to significant racial disparities, with Black mothers experiencing substantially higher infant mortality rates (coefficient of 6.66), emphasizing the need to address systemic inequities in healthcare access and quality.

These findings collectively highlight the intersection of policy and demographic factors in shaping infant health outcomes. The significant DID interaction term underscores the critical role of abortion policy changes in exacerbating infant mortality, particularly in states with pre-existing bans. This analysis not only provides evidence of the public health consequences of restrictive abortion policies but also points to the urgent need for targeted interventions to mitigate these impacts and address disparities across racial and demographic groups.

The model’s performance is supported by its metrics, with a low RMSE indicating accurate predictions and a high R² demonstrating that a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates is explained by the predictors. These results confirm the model’s robustness in capturing the effects of abortion policy changes and demographic factors on infant mortality.Results will likely require summary statistics, tables, graphs, images, and possibly statistical analysis or maps.

Your results section effectively outlines the impact of abortion policies and demographic factors on infant mortality. Here's a concise yet detailed rewrite to meet the standards outlined, ensuring clarity, conciseness, and coherence.

Results
Our findings from two Bayesian models are presented in @tbl-modelresults, capturing the relationship between abortion policies, demographic characteristics, and infant mortality rates.

Key Predictors and Interactions
The analysis demonstrates the significant effects of abortion bans and demographic factors on infant mortality. A notable feature is the positive interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating that abortion bans enacted after the Dobbs decision contributed to a measurable increase in infant mortality rates. This interaction term underscores the amplified impact of combining restrictive abortion laws with the post-injunction period, particularly in states where abortion became illegal.

Independent Effects of Policy and Time
Independent of the interaction, abortion legality and the post-injunction period influence infant mortality in distinct ways. States with abortion bans exhibit elevated infant mortality rates (coefficients of 3.365 in Model 1 and 1.400 in Model 2), suggesting the detrimental impact of restrictive policies. In contrast, the post-injunction period alone correlates with reductions in mortality rates (-0.525 in Model 1 and -0.940 in Model 2), reflecting broader healthcare trends or other unmeasured factors. Together, these results reveal the multifaceted effects of policy and time on public health outcomes.

Maternal Age and Racial Disparities
Demographic factors significantly shape infant mortality trends. Maternal age inversely correlates with mortality, with older mothers (25–34 years) experiencing substantially lower rates (-5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2). Conversely, younger maternal age groups face higher risks, highlighting the vulnerability of younger mothers. Racial disparities are equally stark; Black mothers endure significantly higher infant mortality rates (coefficient of 6.66 in Model 2) compared to Asian mothers, reflecting systemic inequities in access to and quality of healthcare.

Model Performance
Both models exhibit strong predictive performance, with low RMSE values indicating accurate predictions and high R² values showing that a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates is explained by the predictors. These metrics validate the robustness of the models in capturing the influence of abortion policies and demographic characteristics.

Supporting Tables and Visuals
@tbl-modelresults provides a summary of regression coefficients for both models, while accompanying visualizations, including trend graphs and choropleth maps, illustrate the geographical and temporal patterns in infant mortality. Figures and tables help elucidate key findings and offer a comprehensive view of the results.

Results
The results from the two Bayesian models are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal is positive and statistically significant (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating a change in infant mortality rates associated with the combination of abortion bans and the post-injunction period.

For the independent effects, states where abortion is illegal show higher infant mortality rates, with coefficients of 3.365 in Model 1 and 1.400 in Model 2. The post-injunction period alone is associated with coefficients of -0.525 in Model 1 and -0.940 in Model 2, indicating a decrease in infant mortality during this time.

Demographic variables also exhibit notable associations. Maternal age is negatively associated with infant mortality, with coefficients for age groups 25–29 and 30–34 of -5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively. The coefficient for Black mothers in Model 2 is 6.66, reflecting higher infant mortality compared to other racial groups.

The models performed well, with low RMSE values and high R² values, indicating that the predictors account for a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates. Additional tables and visualizations, including @fig-rateandstate and @fig-map, provide further context to these numerical results.

These findings collectively illustrate the complex interaction of policy and demographics in shaping infant mortality outcomes.

## Public Health Implications of Restrictive Abortion Laws

Our study underscores the significant public health impacts of abortion bans in the United States. The observed increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states implementing abortion bans after the Dobbs decision highlights how restrictive abortion policies exacerbate health disparities. These results align with broader public health concerns, as higher infant mortality rates often indicate gaps in prenatal care, healthcare access, and socioeconomic equity. Addressing these systemic issues is critical to mitigating the unintended consequences of such legislation, particularly in states with pre-existing healthcare challenges.

## Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities

The analysis reveals stark racial disparities, with Black mothers experiencing disproportionately higher infant mortality rates compared to other racial groups. These disparities are compounded by restrictive abortion laws, which disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. The intersection of systemic healthcare inequities, socioeconomic challenges, and restrictive legislation amplifies health risks for marginalized communities. Future policy interventions must prioritize equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare to address these disparities and prevent further exacerbation of health inequities.

## Policy and Healthcare Systems Integration

The findings also suggest broader implications for maternal and infant health outcomes under restrictive abortion policies. The significant interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period illustrates how these policies influence infant mortality rates. This compounded effect highlights the need for integrated healthcare systems that can address high-risk pregnancies, improve prenatal care, and ensure equitable access to healthcare services. Policymakers should consider the long-term implications of abortion bans on public health and invest in strategies that safeguard maternal and infant health, particularly in regions most affected by restrictive legislation.

## Data and Temporal Limitations

A key limitation of our analysis is the temporal and demographic scope of the dataset. The data includes only infant deaths under 1 year of age occurring within the United States to U.S. residents during 2021–2022. Infants who died in 2023 are not included, even though they may still be affected by the Dobbs decision, given that infants are defined as under 1 year old. Consequently, the dataset does not capture a full year of infant mortality outcomes following the Dobbs decision, limiting the ability to fully assess the longer-term effects of abortion bans. Future research should focus on incorporating more comprehensive and updated datasets to provide a clearer and more complete analysis of these trends and their long-term implications.

## Weaknesses and next steps

While this study provides critical insights, there are limitations to consider. The analysis relies on aggregate state-level data, which may not capture intra-state disparities or localized effects of abortion laws. Additionally, unmeasured confounders, such as economic conditions or healthcare system differences, may influence the results. Future research should explore the long-term impacts of abortion policies, integrate more granular data, and include qualitative studies to better understand the lived experiences of affected populations. These efforts can inform evidence-based policies that promote equitable health outcomes and mitigate the adverse effects of restrictive abortion laws. make them more logic and naturally

Key Findings and Implications
The analysis reveals distinct patterns in infant mortality rates across various policy and demographic factors. In states where abortion remained legal, the post-injunction period (after_injunction1) is linked to reductions in infant mortality rates by 0.525 and 0.940 deaths per 1,000 live births in Models 1 and 2, respectively. However, states with abortion bans (abortion_illegal1) exhibit significantly higher infant mortality rates, with increases of 3.365 deaths in Model 1 and 1.400 deaths in Model 2. The Difference-in-Differences (DID) interaction term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1) reveals that abortion bans during the post-injunction period result in an additional increase of 0.111 deaths in Model 1 and 0.280 deaths in Model 2. Demographic factors also play a critical role, with older maternal age (25–34 years) reducing infant mortality rates, while younger mothers (15–19 years) face elevated risks. Black mothers experience disproportionately higher infant mortality rates, with an increase of 6.660 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to Asian mothers. These findings collectively emphasize the compounded effects of policy and demographic disparities on infant health outcomes.

Public Health Implications of Restrictive Abortion Laws
The findings highlight the significant public health consequences of abortion bans in the United States. The observed increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states enforcing abortion bans after the Dobbs decision underscores the detrimental impact of restrictive abortion policies. These increases often reflect systemic issues such as inadequate prenatal care, gaps in healthcare access, and underlying socioeconomic inequities. States with pre-existing healthcare challenges may experience amplified effects, suggesting an urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions to address these disparities. Tackling the root causes of these health disparities—such as improving prenatal care, expanding healthcare access, and addressing socioeconomic inequalities—will be essential for mitigating the unintended consequences of restrictive abortion legislation.

Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities
The results reveal stark racial disparities in infant mortality rates, with Black mothers experiencing significantly higher rates compared to other racial groups. These disparities are exacerbated by restrictive abortion policies, which disproportionately affect already vulnerable populations. The intersection of systemic healthcare inequities, socioeconomic challenges, and restrictive legislation creates compounded risks for marginalized communities, leading to worse health outcomes. Addressing these inequities requires targeted policies that ensure equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare, particularly in communities most impacted by these disparities. Such policies should prioritize investments in healthcare infrastructure, culturally competent care, and programs that support at-risk populations.

Integration of Policy and Healthcare Systems
The significant interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period illustrates the compounded impact of restrictive abortion policies on infant mortality rates. These findings underscore the need for integrated healthcare systems that can address the consequences of high-risk pregnancies, improve prenatal care, and ensure equitable access to medical services. Policymakers must consider the broader public health implications of abortion bans and implement strategies that safeguard maternal and infant health. This includes enhancing healthcare delivery in underserved areas, investing in community-based interventions, and ensuring that restrictive policies are accompanied by measures to mitigate their public health impact.

Data and Temporal Limitations
The scope and temporal limitations of the dataset present a notable constraint in this analysis. The data includes only infant deaths under 1 year of age occurring within the United States to U.S. residents during 2021–2022. This timeframe does not capture the full year of infant mortality outcomes following the Dobbs decision, as infants who died in 2023 are not included. Furthermore, the dataset's focus on infants under 1 year of age may exclude cases that reflect longer-term health impacts. These limitations could lead to an underestimation of the full effects of abortion bans. Future research should incorporate more comprehensive and updated datasets to provide a clearer and more complete analysis of the long-term trends and implications of restrictive abortion policies.

Weaknesses and Future Directions
While this study provides valuable findings, several limitations should be addressed in future research. The analysis relies on aggregate state-level data, which may obscure localized effects and intra-state disparities. Unmeasured confounders, such as economic conditions, healthcare infrastructure differences, or state-specific policies, could also influence the results. Moreover, the short timeframe of the dataset limits the ability to assess the long-term effects of abortion policies. Future research should integrate more granular data, such as county-level analyses, and extend the study period to capture longer-term impacts. Qualitative studies focusing on the lived experiences of affected populations can complement quantitative analyses, offering a deeper understanding of the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws. These efforts will support the development of evidence-based policies aimed at reducing disparities and improving maternal and infant health outcomes.

# Introduction

The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, through the Supreme
Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ended
nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights.
This landmark ruling shifted authority over abortion regulations to
individual states, creating a patchwork of laws nationwide. The decision
reignited debates about reproductive rights and public health,
highlighting disparities in access to abortion services and their
effects on health outcomes, especially in states with restrictive
policies.

Banning abortion usually has been linked to a rise in maternal mortality
rates, with Texas experiencing a 56% increase from 2019 to 2022
[@nbcnews]. However, restrictive abortion laws can also impact infant
mortality, as they often lead to more unintended or high-risk
pregnancies among disadvantaged populations with limited access to
healthcare. These pregnancies are associated with higher rates of
preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications, all of
which elevate infant mortality rates. Even before Roe v. Wade was
overturned, researchers highlighted the impacts of restrictive abortion
laws on mortality rates. @Burdick2024 found that states with 11–12
restrictive laws during 2014–2018 had a 16% higher infant mortality
rate, particularly in counties with higher proportions of Black
populations, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal smoking. Similarly,
@Harper2023 showed that restrictive laws are linked to higher maternal,
fetal, and infant mortality, states with moderate abortion legislation
had significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live
births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to
restrictive states, underscoring the health benefits of less restrictive
policies.

The estimand of our analysis is the change in the difference in infant
death rates between states that banned abortion and states where
abortion remained legal after June 24, 2022. The object of the
estimation is to estimate the change in the difference in the infant
death rate between the treatment and control groups based on
observational data in the United States.

Instead of examining the impact of abortion laws over broader time
periods like prior research, our study focuses on the effect of abortion
bans on infant mortality rates in the United States specifically from
2021 to 2022, with an emphasis on changes following the 2022 Dobbs
decision. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we assess
the interaction between abortion legality in states and the timing of
the injunction implemented to understand its influence on infant health
outcomes. The study utilizes observational data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database, capturing infant
mortality trends across states with varying levels of abortion
restrictiveness. Key predictors include the mother’s state of residence,
race, age, and the year of infant death, enabling a nuanced examination
of the effects of restrictive abortion laws on public health.

Our Results show that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the
implementation of abortion bans are linked to a rise in infant mortality
rates in states where abortion became illegal. Through a
Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we estimate that states
enforcing abortion bans after the injunction saw an increase of 0.285
deaths per 1,000 live births compared to states where abortion remained
legal. Furthermore, we find that maternal age and race are key
determinants of infant mortality, with older maternal age groups
associated with lower mortality rates and Black mothers experiencing
significantly higher rates. These results emphasize the public health
consequences of restrictive abortion laws and the urgent need for
policies that mitigate these disparities.

This study is important as we highlight the public health implications
of abortion bans, particularly their role in increasing infant mortality
rates. By focusing on the 2022 Dobbs decision, we provide timely
evidence on how restrictive abortion policies disproportionately affect
vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for data-driven policies to
mitigate these adverse outcomes.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We conduct our infant death rate observational data analysis using the R
programming language [@citeR]. Our dataset, obtained from CDC
Wonder[@cdc_wonder_2024], based on data as of December 2022, provides a
detailed overview of the Infant Death Rate across the USA. CDC WONDER
(Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) is an online
system providing public health professionals and the public with access
to a wide range of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
epidemiologic data and resources. Following the guidelines outlined in
@tellingstories, we analyze the impact of abortion injunctions on infant
death rates using the Difference-in-Difference method. This approach
utilizes the interaction between the legality of abortion in the
mother’s state of residence and the timing of the infant’s death as the
predictor variable. Additionally, we include control variables such as
infant year of death, the mother’s state of residence, race, and age to
account for potential confounding factors.

## Measurement

The process of translating real-world events into our dataset requires a
systematic approach to measurement and data gathering. In this research,
we analyze infant mortality rates in the United States to understand the
impact of abortion policies and demographic factors. The CDC’s Linked
Birth/Infant Death Records database provides comprehensive data,
including maternal and infant characteristics, to support this study.
Variables such as maternal age, race, education, birth weight,
gestational age, and prenatal care are included to ensure a detailed
examination of factors influencing infant health outcomes.

The data, sourced from birth and death certificates, undergoes a
thorough cleaning and validation process to address inconsistencies and
missing information, ensuring accuracy. Infant mortality rates are
calculated per 1,000 live births, with additional indicators such as
reliability labels for rates based on fewer than 20 deaths. To further
enhance data accuracy, weights are applied to adjust for unlinked infant
death records, ensuring that all deaths—linked and unlinked—are
proportionally represented. Weights are calculated for each state and
infant age-at-death cohort (\<7 days, 7-27 days, and 28 days to 1 year)
using the formula:
$\text{Weight} = \frac{\text{Linked deaths} + \text{Unlinked deaths}}{\text{Linked deaths}}$
This adjustment means areas with complete linkages have a weight of 1.0,
while areas with incomplete linkages are adjusted proportionally.
Additionally, imputation techniques are employed to handle missing
birthweight data, assigning values based on gestational period, race,
sex, and plurality, further reducing potential bias in the analysis.

Once cleaned, the data is stratified by maternal and infant attributes,
providing insights into trends and disparities across demographic
groups. Statistical models are employed to estimate associations between
state-level abortion policies and infant mortality, controlling for
confounders such as maternal characteristics. This structured approach
transforms complex datasets into actionable insights, shedding light on
the health implications of varying abortion laws across the U.S. By
leveraging comprehensive datasets and robust statistical techniques,
this study offers a nuanced understanding of the intersection between
policy, demographics, and infant health outcomes, informing public
health strategies and legislative decisions.

## Outcome variables

### Death Rate

The death rate refers to the number of deaths of infants under one
year of age per 1,000 live births in a specified population during a
given time period. It serves as a key indicator of a population’s
overall health and access to healthcare. Rates labeled as "Unreliable"
occur when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator, as these
figures do not meet the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
standards for reliability or precision. After cleaning the dataset, the
"Unreliable" label is converted into a separate variable named
reliable.

@fig-deathrate illustrates the distribution of infant death rates (per
1,000 live births) based on the available data. The majority of infant
death rates cluster around lower values, with a peak observed between 5
and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants. As the death rate increases, the
frequency of occurrences decreases, indicating that higher infant death
rates are relatively rare. There are few instances where the rate
exceeds 20 deaths per 1,000 infants, suggesting these are outliers.
Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance
of lower infant death rates in the dataset.

## Predictor variables

### Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction

Abortion legality (named abortion_illegal in the dataset) is a newly
created variable in our dataset, which refers to the legal status of
abortion within a given state. It is represented as a binary variable,
where 1 indicates that abortion is illegal in the state, and 0 indicates
that abortion is legal. This classification reflects the policies and
laws governing abortion access in each state.

Another created variable after_injunction indicates whether the date
of infants' death falls after the implementation of the abortion
injunctions following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. It is
coded as a binary variable, where 1 represents dates after June 2022,
signifying the post-injunction period, and 0 represents dates before
June 2022, indicating the pre-injunction period.

To evaluate the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates, we
utilize the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method. As part of this
approach, we construct an interaction term defined as the product of
abortion_illegal and after_injunction. The resulting interaction
term equals 1 when abortion is illegal and the time is after the
injunction, and 0 otherwise. This term is included in the analysis to
evaluate the joint impact of these factors on infant death rates.

categorized as ‘1’, where abortion became illegal after the injunction,
show a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 compared to 7.9 in ‘0’
states, where abortion remained legal or abortion used to be legal
before the injunction. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies
and their enforcement may contribute to higher infant mortality,
potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies,
reduced access to maternal healthcare, and exacerbated social or
economic disparities.

## Control Variables

### Year of Death

The Year of Death variable represents the calendar year in which the
infant death occurred, specifically focusing on the years 2021 and 2022
in this study. This variable is essential for analyzing temporal trends
and identifying patterns or shifts in infant mortality rates over this
critical period. By controlling the year of death, we can closely
examine the impact of significant policy changes, such as the
overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, as well as other temporal factors on
infant health outcomes.

### State

The state of the mother’s legal residence at the time of birth. This
data is categorized by the mother’s state of residence and excludes
territories.

color intensity. States with higher infant death rates are shown in
lighter shades (yellow), while states with lower rates are represented
in darker shades (purple). States with missing data are indicated in
grey. The map highlights disparities in infant mortality rates, with
some states, particularly in the southeastern U.S., exhibiting notably
higher rates compared to others. States like Alabama and Mississippi
show the highest rates, while states such as California and New York
exhibit lower rates.

### Age of Mother

The Age of Mother (age_of_mother) refers to the age group of the
mother at the time of childbirth.In our observational data, age is
categorized into the brackets 15–19 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, and
30–34 years in the raw data, in compliance with privacy requirements.

@tbl-motherage displays the average infant death rate (per 1,000 live
births) by the age group of mothers. It shows a clear trend: younger
mothers, particularly those aged 15–19 and 20–24, have higher infant
death rates (9.0 and 10.0, respectively), while older mothers in the
25–29 and 30–34 age groups have lower rates (7.4 and 6.6, respectively).
This suggests that maternal age may be a factor influencing infant
mortality, with younger mothers experiencing higher risks.

# Model

For our analysis, we use a Bayesian Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to quantify the impact of abortion injunctions on the infant death rate across states in the USA. This method compares changes in infant death rates over time between a treatment group (states where abortion injunctions were implemented) and a control group (states where abortion remains legal), providing a robust framework for estimating causal effects.

## Difference-In-Difference Approach (DID)

Difference-in-Differences (DID) is a causal inference method that estimates the impact of an intervention by comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. By assuming parallel trends in the absence of the intervention, the DID framework isolates the intervention’s effect through **the interaction between time periods (pre- and post-intervention) and group membership**. This makes it a robust method for evaluating policy changes and other significant events.

### Assumption

The validity of the Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach in our study relies on several key assumptions, which, if violated, could affect the robustness and reliability of our results [@cunningham2021]:

#### Parallel Trends Assumption

The model relies on the assumption that, without the abortion injunction, the treatment group (states where abortion became illegal) and the control group (states where abortion remained legal) would have followed similar trends in infant mortality rates. However, this assumption can be challenged by differences in healthcare systems, socioeconomic conditions, or pre-existing policy environments, which may cause deviations from parallel trends.

#### Compositional Differences

In addition to parallel trends, compositional changes in repeated cross-sectional data over time can influence results. For instance, shifts in demographic factors such as maternal age or racial makeup between pre- and post-intervention periods may confound the observed changes in infant mortality rates. Including control variables helps adjust for these confounders, ensuring that the estimated effect reflects the policy intervention rather than changes in population composition.

#### Long-term Effects vs. Reliability

The length of the analysis period further complicates the reliability of results. While longer periods allow for capturing long-term effects, they also increase the likelihood of unrelated factors, such as new policies or healthcare advancements, influencing the outcome. Over time, some states in the control group may also implement similar abortion policies, diluting the treatment effect. Conversely, shorter analysis periods 

#### Functional Form Dependence

Finally, the model assumes that the functional relationship between predictors and outcomes is correctly specified. If this assumption is violated, differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups may stem from misspecified relationships rather than the intervention itself. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing the model’s structure and assumptions to ensure valid results.

## Model Parameters
The model focuses on the infant death rate per 1,000 live births as the dependent variable and includes the following independent variables:

- **Treatment Group Indicator abortion_illegal**: A binary variable indicating the group: 1 if abortion is illegal in the state. 0 if abortion remains legal.

-	**Time Indicator after_injunction**: A binary variable indicating the time period: 0 for the period before the injunction implemented. 1 for the period after the injunction implemented.

-	**Interaction Termafter_injunction × abortion_illegal**: The interaction term captures the additional change in the outcome (e.g., percentage of support, behavior, or health-related metrics) for regions where abortion is illegal after the injunction implemented, beyond any changes observed in regions where abortion remains legal.

Additionally, we include these control variables to adjust for demographic and temporal factors that could influence infant mortality rates, ensuring that the estimated effects are not confounded by these characteristics:

- **age_of_mother**: The age of the mother at the time of birth, represented as a continuous variable.

- **mothers_single_race**: Self-identified race of the mother, represented as a categorical variable.

- **year_of_death**:  The year in which the infant death occurred, represented as a continuous variable.

Finally, we include a random variable:

- **state**: Mother's residence state when the infant born as a random effect in the model. 

By isolating the impact of the abortion injunction through this interaction term after_injunction×abortion_illegal, our model identifies changes in infant death rates that can be attributed to the policy intervention. Additional details and diagnostics supporting the model’s implementation are provided in [Appendix-@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

In our analysis, we employ two models. The first model includes only the predictor variables and the random effect for state. The second model builds on the first by incorporating additional control variables to account for potential confounding factors.

Define $y_i$ as as the infant death rate per 1,000 live births, and $\gamma_j$ as the random state effect. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i|\mu_i,\sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma)\\
\text{First Model}: \mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction} + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}\\&+\beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i+\gamma_j\\
\text{Second Model}:\mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+ \beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+\beta_4\cdot\text{Year of Death}_i+\beta_5\cdot\text{Age of Mother}_i+\beta_6\cdot\text{Mother's Single Race}_i+\gamma_j\\
\beta_0 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_1 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_2 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_3 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_4 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_5 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_6 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\gamma_j&\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_j^2)\\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{aligned}
$$

The models are run in R (R Core Team 2023) using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. The default priors from rstanarm are used for both GLM Bayesian models. We run the model in R [@citeR] using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from rstanarm used for both Gaussian Bayesian models.

### Model justification

For our analysis, we use separate Bayesian regression models to estimate the infant death rates in states where abortion injunctions were implemented and in states where abortion remains legal. We use the interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal to measure the causal effect of the abortion injunction. Both models share the same predictors to ensure consistency and comparability in capturing the determinants of infant mortality.

For one of our models, we include control variables (age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, and year_of_death) to adjust for confounders that could influence infant death rates, addressing the assumption of compositional differences in the DID approach and ensuring unbiased estimates of the intervention’s effect. In the other model, we exclude these controls to focus on the overall intervention impact, avoid overfitting, and prioritize simplicity when variability is adequately accounted for by the design or random effects. Thus, our decision to fit two models is to compare the outcomes: one adjusts for confounders to refine the estimates, while the other focuses on the direct effect of the intervention.

Our model includes state as a random effect to account for regional variations in infant mortality that could introduce bias. We use a random effect rather than a fixed effect to capture variability across states without estimating specific effects for each one. This approach models unobserved heterogeneity, such as differences in healthcare systems and socioeconomic conditions, using a single variance term, which avoids overfitting and ensures efficiency and generalizability. By adjusting for unmeasured state-specific factors, the model provides robust and reliable findings while balancing parsimony and interpretability, making it well-suited for our analysis.

We choose the Bayesian framework since it enhances the DID approach by incorporating prior information and quantifying uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. In our Bayesian models, we use weakly informative priors from the rstanarm package, including a Normal prior ($\mu=0$ and $\sigma=2.5$) for fixed effects and an Exponential prior (rate = 1) for the auxiliary parameter, with autoscale=TRUE to dynamically adjust priors based on data scale. This enhances convergence and ensures priors are calibrated to predictor ranges without dominating the data. The model assumes plausible parameter centering, random effects capture unobserved heterogeneity, and the DID framework relies on parallel trends between groups. However, limitations include potential bias from misspecified priors, computational challenges for hierarchical models, and sensitivity to data sparsity or imbalances. This model may not be suitable if group-level effects are negligible, parallel trends are violated, or data is insufficient, but when applied appropriately, it provides robust and interpretable causal estimates.

The results from the two Bayesian models are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal is positive and statistically significant (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating a change in infant mortality rates associated with the combination of abortion bans and the post-injunction period.

For the independent effects, states where abortion is illegal show higher infant mortality rates, with coefficients of 3.365 in Model 1 and 1.400 in Model 2. The post-injunction period alone is associated with coefficients of -0.525 in Model 1 and -0.940 in Model 2, indicating a decrease in infant mortality during this time.

Demographic variables also exhibit notable associations. Maternal age is negatively associated with infant mortality, with coefficients for age groups 25–29 and 30–34 of -5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively. The coefficient for Black mothers in Model 2 is 6.66, reflecting higher infant mortality compared to other racial groups.

The models performed well, with low RMSE values and high $R^2$ values, indicating that the predictors account for a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates. 

# Discussion

## Key Findings and Implications

The analysis reveals distinct patterns in infant mortality rates across various policy and demographic factors. In states where abortion remained legal, the post-injunction period (after_injunction1) is linked to reductions in infant mortality rates by 0.525 and 0.940 deaths per 1,000 live births in Models 1 and 2, respectively. However, states with abortion bans (abortion_illegal1) exhibit significantly higher infant mortality rates, with increases of 3.365 deaths in Model 1 and 1.400 deaths in Model 2. The DID interaction term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1) reveals that abortion bans during the post-injunction period result in an additional increase of 0.111 deaths in Model 1 and 0.280 deaths in Model 2. Demographic factors also play a critical role, with older maternal age (25–34 years) reducing infant mortality rates, while younger mothers (15–19 years) face elevated risks. Black mothers experience disproportionately higher infant mortality rates, with an increase of 6.660 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to Asian mothers. These findings collectively emphasize the compounded effects of policy and demographic disparities on infant health outcomes.

## Public Health Implications of Restrictive Abortion Laws

The findings highlight the significant public health consequences of abortion bans in the United States. The observed increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states enforcing abortion bans after the Dobbs decision underscores the detrimental impact of restrictive abortion policies. These increases often reflect systemic issues such as inadequate prenatal care, gaps in healthcare access, and underlying socioeconomic inequities. States with pre-existing healthcare challenges may experience amplified effects, suggesting an urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions to address these disparities. Tackling the root causes of these health disparities—such as improving prenatal care, expanding healthcare access, and addressing socioeconomic inequalities—will be essential for mitigating the unintended consequences of restrictive abortion legislation.

## Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities

The results reveal stark racial disparities in infant mortality rates, with Black mothers experiencing significantly higher rates compared to other racial groups. These disparities are exacerbated by restrictive abortion policies, which disproportionately affect already vulnerable populations. The intersection of systemic healthcare inequities, socioeconomic challenges, and restrictive legislation creates compounded risks for marginalized communities, leading to worse health outcomes. Addressing these inequities requires targeted policies that ensure equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare, particularly in communities most impacted by these disparities. Such policies should prioritize investments in healthcare infrastructure, culturally competent care, and programs that support at-risk populations.

## Integration of Policy and Healthcare Systems

The significant interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period illustrates the compounded impact of restrictive abortion policies on infant mortality rates. These findings underscore the need for integrated healthcare systems that can address the consequences of high-risk pregnancies, improve prenatal care, and ensure equitable access to medical services. Policymakers must consider the broader public health implications of abortion bans and implement strategies that safeguard maternal and infant health. This includes enhancing healthcare delivery in underserved areas, investing in community-based interventions, and ensuring that restrictive policies are accompanied by measures to mitigate their public health impact.

## Data and Temporal Limitations

A key limitation of our analysis is the temporal and demographic scope of the dataset. The data includes only infant deaths under 1 year of age occurring within the United States to U.S. residents during 2021–2022. This timeframe does not capture the full year of infant mortality outcomes following the Dobbs decision, as infants who died in 2023 are not included. Furthermore, the dataset’s focus on infants under 1 year of age may exclude cases that reflect longer-term health impacts. These limitations could lead to an underestimation of the full effects of abortion bans. Future research should incorporate more comprehensive and updated datasets to provide a clearer and more complete analysis of the long-term trends and implications of restrictive abortion policies.

## Weaknesses and Future Directions

While this study provides valuable findings, several limitations should be addressed in future research. The analysis relies on aggregate state-level data, which may obscure localized effects and intra-state disparities. Unmeasured confounders, such as economic conditions, healthcare infrastructure differences, or state-specific policies, could also influence the results. Moreover, the short timeframe of the dataset limits the ability to assess the long-term effects of abortion policies. Future research should integrate more granular data, such as county-level analyses, and extend the study period to capture longer-term impacts. Qualitative studies focusing on the lived experiences of affected populations can complement quantitative analyses, offering a deeper understanding of the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws. These efforts will support the development of evidence-based policies aimed at reducing disparities and improving maternal and infant health outcomes.

Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we analyze trends in states where abortion remained legal compared to those where it became illegal after June 2022. Our results indicate that states enforcing abortion bans experienced an increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, with compounded effects observed during the post-injunction period. Maternal age and race also emerged as significant predictors, with Black mothers facing disproportionately higher infant mortality rates. These findings underscore the compounded public health implications of restrictive abortion policies and the urgent need for targeted interventions to address racial and demographic disparities. By leveraging recent, high-quality data and rigorous modeling, this study provides critical insights into the intersection of reproductive rights and infant health outcomes.

You said:
You should pick at least one of the following and include it to enhance your submission: 1) a datasheet for the dataset; 2) a model card for the model; 3) a Shiny application; 4) an R package; or 5) an API for the model. If you would like to include an enhancement not on this list please email the instructor with your idea.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Based on your project, a model card for the model or a Shiny application could be excellent enhancements to your submission. Here’s a brief justification and suggestion for each:

1) Model Card for the Bayesian Difference-in-Differences Model
A model card provides a clear, structured summary of the model's purpose, assumptions, evaluation, and limitations. Given the sensitivity of your topic and the potential for misuse or misunderstanding, a model card would:

Clarify the scope and intended use of the model.
Highlight key assumptions like parallel trends and data limitations.
Describe performance metrics, including RMSE and $R^2$, for transparency.
Provide warnings against misuse, such as overgeneralizing findings or applying the model to unrelated datasets.
Implementation:
You could adapt templates from tools like Hugging Face’s model card guide or reference the model card format from Mitchell et al. (2019).

2) Shiny Application for Interactive Exploration
A Shiny application would allow users to interact with the dataset and visualize results dynamically. For example:

Users could select states or demographics to see how infant mortality rates change before and after the Dobbs decision.
Sliders could adjust assumptions (e.g., maternal age ranges or inclusion/exclusion of certain covariates).
Outputs could include dynamic maps, regression plots, or DID interaction graphs.
Implementation:

Use the shiny package in R to create the app.
Incorporate interactive visualizations using ggplot2 and plotly.
Host the app on ShinyApps.io or a personal server.
Recommendation:
If time allows, a model card is quicker to implement and aligns well with transparency and reproducibility goals. However, a Shiny app would enhance user engagement and make your findings accessible to non-technical audiences. You could even combine the two by linking the app and card in your submission. Let me know which you'd prefer, and I can help you get started!

# Introduction

The overturning of Roe v. Wade on June 24, 2022, through the Supreme
Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, ended
nearly five decades of constitutional protection for abortion rights.
This landmark ruling shifted authority over abortion regulations to
individual states, creating a patchwork of laws nationwide. The decision
reignited debates about reproductive rights and public health,
highlighting disparities in access to abortion services and their
effects on health outcomes, especially in states with restrictive
policies.

Banning abortion usually has been linked to a rise in maternal mortality
rates, with Texas experiencing a 56% increase from 2019 to 2022
[@nbcnews]. However, restrictive abortion laws can also impact infant
mortality, as they often lead to more unintended or high-risk
pregnancies among disadvantaged populations with limited access to
healthcare. These pregnancies are associated with higher rates of
preterm births, low birth weights, and delivery complications, all of
which elevate infant mortality rates. Even before Roe v. Wade was
overturned, researchers highlighted the impacts of restrictive abortion
laws on mortality rates. @Burdick2024 found that states with 11–12
restrictive laws during 2014–2018 had a 16% higher infant mortality
rate, particularly in counties with higher proportions of Black
populations, inadequate prenatal care, and maternal smoking. Similarly,
@Harper2023 showed that restrictive laws are linked to higher maternal,
fetal, and infant mortality, states with moderate abortion legislation
had significantly lower maternal mortality (25.79 per 100,000 live
births) and infant mortality (20.56 per 1,000 live births) compared to
restrictive states, underscoring the health benefits of less restrictive
policies.

The estimand of our analysis is the change in the difference in infant
death rates between states that banned abortion and states where
abortion remained legal after June 24, 2022. The object of the
estimation is to estimate the change in the difference in the infant
death rate between the treatment and control groups based on
observational data in the United States.

Instead of examining the impact of abortion laws over broader time
periods like prior research, our study focuses on the effect of abortion
bans on infant mortality rates in the United States specifically from
2021 to 2022, with an emphasis on changes following the 2022 Dobbs
decision. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we assess
the interaction between abortion legality in states and the timing of
the injunction implemented to understand its influence on infant health
outcomes. The study utilizes observational data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention’s WONDER database, capturing infant
mortality trends across states with varying levels of abortion
restrictiveness. Key predictors include the mother’s state of residence,
race, age, and the year of infant death, enabling a nuanced examination
of the effects of restrictive abortion laws on public health.

Our Results show that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the
implementation of abortion bans are linked to a rise in infant mortality
rates in states where abortion became illegal. Through a
Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, we estimate that states
enforcing abortion bans after the injunction saw an increase of 0.285
deaths per 1,000 live births compared to states where abortion remained
legal. Furthermore, we find that maternal age and race are key
determinants of infant mortality, with older maternal age groups
associated with lower mortality rates and Black mothers experiencing
significantly higher rates. These results emphasize the public health
consequences of restrictive abortion laws and the urgent need for
policies that mitigate these disparities.

This study is important as we highlight the public health implications
of abortion bans, particularly their role in increasing infant mortality
rates. By focusing on the 2022 Dobbs decision, we provide timely
evidence on how restrictive abortion policies disproportionately affect
vulnerable populations, emphasizing the need for data-driven policies to
mitigate these adverse outcomes.

# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

We conduct our infant death rate observational data analysis using the R
programming language [@citeR]. Our dataset, obtained from CDC
Wonder[@cdc_wonder_2024], based on data as of December 2022, provides a
detailed overview of the Infant Death Rate across the USA. CDC WONDER
(Wide-ranging ONline Data for Epidemiologic Research) is an online
system providing public health professionals and the public with access
to a wide range of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
epidemiologic data and resources. Following the guidelines outlined in
@tellingstories, we analyze the impact of abortion injunctions on infant
death rates using the Difference-in-Difference method. This approach
utilizes the interaction between the legality of abortion in the
mother’s state of residence and the timing of the infant’s death as the
predictor variable. Additionally, we include control variables such as
infant year of death, the mother’s state of residence, race, and age to
account for potential confounding factors.

## Measurement

The process of translating real-world events into our dataset requires a
systematic approach to measurement and data gathering. In this research,
we analyze infant mortality rates in the United States to understand the
impact of abortion policies and demographic factors. The CDC’s Linked
Birth/Infant Death Records database provides comprehensive data,
including maternal and infant characteristics, to support this study.
Variables such as maternal age, race, education, birth weight,
gestational age, and prenatal care are included to ensure a detailed
examination of factors influencing infant health outcomes.

The data, sourced from birth and death certificates, undergoes a
thorough cleaning and validation process to address inconsistencies and
missing information, ensuring accuracy. Infant mortality rates are
calculated per 1,000 live births, with additional indicators such as
reliability labels for rates based on fewer than 20 deaths. To further
enhance data accuracy, weights are applied to adjust for unlinked infant
death records, ensuring that all deaths—linked and unlinked—are
proportionally represented. Weights are calculated for each state and
infant age-at-death cohort (\<7 days, 7-27 days, and 28 days to 1 year)
using the formula:
$\text{Weight} = \frac{\text{Linked deaths} + \text{Unlinked deaths}}{\text{Linked deaths}}$
This adjustment means areas with complete linkages have a weight of 1.0,
while areas with incomplete linkages are adjusted proportionally.
Additionally, imputation techniques are employed to handle missing
birthweight data, assigning values based on gestational period, race,
sex, and plurality, further reducing potential bias in the analysis.

Once cleaned, the data is stratified by maternal and infant attributes,
providing insights into trends and disparities across demographic
groups. Statistical models are employed to estimate associations between
state-level abortion policies and infant mortality, controlling for
confounders such as maternal characteristics. This structured approach
transforms complex datasets into actionable insights, shedding light on
the health implications of varying abortion laws across the U.S. By
leveraging comprehensive datasets and robust statistical techniques,
this study offers a nuanced understanding of the intersection between
policy, demographics, and infant health outcomes, informing public
health strategies and legislative decisions.

## Outcome variables

### Death Rate

The death rate refers to the number of deaths of infants under one
year of age per 1,000 live births in a specified population during a
given time period. It serves as a key indicator of a population’s
overall health and access to healthcare. Rates labeled as "Unreliable"
occur when there are fewer than 20 deaths in the numerator, as these
figures do not meet the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
standards for reliability or precision. After cleaning the dataset, the
"Unreliable" label is converted into a separate variable named
reliable.

{r}
#| label: fig-deathrate
#| fig-cap: The distribution of infant death rate (per 1,000 live births), with a peak observed between 5 and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants.The distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance of lower infant death rates in the dataset.

  ) +theme_classic()


@fig-deathrate illustrates the distribution of infant death rates (per
1,000 live births) based on the available data. The majority of infant
death rates cluster around lower values, with a peak observed between 5
and 10 deaths per 1,000 infants. As the death rate increases, the
frequency of occurrences decreases, indicating that higher infant death
rates are relatively rare. There are few instances where the rate
exceeds 20 deaths per 1,000 infants, suggesting these are outliers.
Overall, the distribution is right-skewed, highlighting the predominance
of lower infant death rates in the dataset.

## Predictor variables

### Interaction Term: Abortion Legality and After Injunction

Abortion legality (named abortion_illegal in the dataset) is a newly
created variable in our dataset, which refers to the legal status of
abortion within a given state. It is represented as a binary variable,
where 1 indicates that abortion is illegal in the state, and 0 indicates
that abortion is legal. This classification reflects the policies and
laws governing abortion access in each state.

Another created variable after_injunction indicates whether the date
of infants' death falls after the implementation of the abortion
injunctions following the overturn of Roe v. Wade in June 2022. It is
coded as a binary variable, where 1 represents dates after June 2022,
signifying the post-injunction period, and 0 represents dates before
June 2022, indicating the pre-injunction period.

To evaluate the impact of abortion injunctions on infant death rates, we
utilize the Difference-in-Difference (DID) method. As part of this
approach, we construct an interaction term defined as the product of
abortion_illegal and after_injunction. The resulting interaction
term equals 1 when abortion is illegal and the time is after the
injunction, and 0 otherwise. This term is included in the analysis to
evaluate the joint impact of these factors on infant death rates.

In states with abortion bans, infant mortality shows a slight increase
after June 2022, marked by the dashed line representing the overturn of
Roe v. Wade. In contrast, states where abortion remains legal exhibit
relatively stable trends. This suggests a potential link between
abortion bans and rising infant mortality rates, warranting further
investigation.

@tbl-interact highlights average infant death rates (per 1,000 live
births) based on abortion legality and injunction timing. States
categorized as ‘1’, where abortion became illegal after the injunction,
show a higher average infant death rate of 8.3 compared to 7.9 in ‘0’
states, where abortion remained legal or abortion used to be legal
before the injunction. This suggests that restrictive abortion policies
and their enforcement may contribute to higher infant mortality,
potentially due to increased unintended or high-risk pregnancies,
reduced access to maternal healthcare, and exacerbated social or
economic disparities.

## Control Variables

### Year of Death

The Year of Death variable represents the calendar year in which the
infant death occurred, specifically focusing on the years 2021 and 2022
in this study. This variable is essential for analyzing temporal trends
and identifying patterns or shifts in infant mortality rates over this
critical period. By controlling the year of death, we can closely
examine the impact of significant policy changes, such as the
overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022, as well as other temporal factors on
infant health outcomes.

### State

The state of the mother’s legal residence at the time of birth. This
data is categorized by the mother’s state of residence and excludes
territories.

grey. The map highlights disparities in infant mortality rates, with
some states, particularly in the southeastern U.S., exhibiting notably
higher rates compared to others. States like Alabama and Mississippi
show the highest rates, while states such as California and New York
exhibit lower rates.

### Age of Mother

The Age of Mother (age_of_mother) refers to the age group of the
mother at the time of childbirth.In our observational data, age is
categorized into the brackets 15–19 years, 20–24 years, 25–29 years, and
30–34 years in the raw data, in compliance with privacy requirements.

@tbl-motherage displays the average infant death rate (per 1,000 live
births) by the age group of mothers. It shows a clear trend: younger
mothers, particularly those aged 15–19 and 20–24, have higher infant
death rates (9.0 and 10.0, respectively), while older mothers in the
25–29 and 30–34 age groups have lower rates (7.4 and 6.6, respectively).
This suggests that maternal age may be a factor influencing infant
mortality, with younger mothers experiencing higher risks.

# Model

For our analysis, we use a Bayesian Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to quantify the impact of abortion injunctions on the infant death rate across states in the USA. This method compares changes in infant death rates over time between a treatment group (states where abortion injunctions were implemented) and a control group (states where abortion remains legal), providing a robust framework for estimating causal effects.

## Difference-In-Difference Approach (DID)

Difference-in-Differences (DID) is a causal inference method that estimates the impact of an intervention by comparing changes in outcomes over time between a treatment group and a control group. By assuming parallel trends in the absence of the intervention, the DID framework isolates the intervention’s effect through **the interaction between time periods (pre- and post-intervention) and group membership**. This makes it a robust method for evaluating policy changes and other significant events.

### Assumption

The validity of the Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach in our study relies on several key assumptions, which, if violated, could affect the robustness and reliability of our results [@cunningham2021]:

#### Parallel Trends Assumption

The model relies on the assumption that, without the abortion injunction, the treatment group (states where abortion became illegal) and the control group (states where abortion remained legal) would have followed similar trends in infant mortality rates. However, this assumption can be challenged by differences in healthcare systems, socioeconomic conditions, or pre-existing policy environments, which may cause deviations from parallel trends.

#### Compositional Differences

In addition to parallel trends, compositional changes in repeated cross-sectional data over time can influence results. For instance, shifts in demographic factors such as maternal age or racial makeup between pre- and post-intervention periods may confound the observed changes in infant mortality rates. Including control variables helps adjust for these confounders, ensuring that the estimated effect reflects the policy intervention rather than changes in population composition.

#### Long-term Effects vs. Reliability

The length of the analysis period further complicates the reliability of results. While longer periods allow for capturing long-term effects, they also increase the likelihood of unrelated factors, such as new policies or healthcare advancements, influencing the outcome. Over time, some states in the control group may also implement similar abortion policies, diluting the treatment effect. Conversely, shorter analysis periods 

#### Functional Form Dependence

Finally, the model assumes that the functional relationship between predictors and outcomes is correctly specified. If this assumption is violated, differences in outcomes between treatment and control groups may stem from misspecified relationships rather than the intervention itself. This highlights the importance of carefully assessing the model’s structure and assumptions to ensure valid results.

## Model Parameters
The model focuses on the infant death rate per 1,000 live births as the dependent variable and includes the following independent variables:

- **Treatment Group Indicator abortion_illegal**: A binary variable indicating the group: 1 if abortion is illegal in the state. 0 if abortion remains legal.

-	**Time Indicator after_injunction**: A binary variable indicating the time period: 0 for the period before the injunction implemented. 1 for the period after the injunction implemented.

-	**Interaction Termafter_injunction × abortion_illegal**: The interaction term captures the additional change in the outcome (e.g., percentage of support, behavior, or health-related metrics) for regions where abortion is illegal after the injunction implemented, beyond any changes observed in regions where abortion remains legal.

Additionally, we include these control variables to adjust for demographic and temporal factors that could influence infant mortality rates, ensuring that the estimated effects are not confounded by these characteristics:

- **age_of_mother**: The age of the mother at the time of birth, represented as a continuous variable.

- **mothers_single_race**: Self-identified race of the mother, represented as a categorical variable.

- **year_of_death**:  The year in which the infant death occurred, represented as a continuous variable.

Finally, we include a random variable:

- **state**: Mother's residence state when the infant born as a random effect in the model. 

By isolating the impact of the abortion injunction through this interaction term after_injunction×abortion_illegal, our model identifies changes in infant death rates that can be attributed to the policy intervention. Additional details and diagnostics supporting the model’s implementation are provided in [Appendix-@sec-model-details].

## Model set-up

In our analysis, we employ two models. The first model includes only the predictor variables and the random effect for state. The second model builds on the first by incorporating additional control variables to account for potential confounding factors.

Define $y_i$ as as the infant death rate per 1,000 live births, and $\gamma_j$ as the random state effect. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i|\mu_i,\sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma)\\
\text{First Model}: \mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction} + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}\\&+\beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i+\gamma_j\\
\text{Second Model}:\mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+ \beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+\beta_4\cdot\text{Year of Death}_i+\beta_5\cdot\text{Age of Mother}_i+\beta_6\cdot\text{Mother's Single Race}_i+\gamma_j\\
\beta_0 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_1 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_2 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_3 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_4 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_5 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_6 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\gamma_j&\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_j^2)\\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{aligned}
$$

The models are run in R (R Core Team 2023) using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. The default priors from rstanarm are used for both GLM Bayesian models. We run the model in R [@citeR] using the rstanarm package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from rstanarm used for both Gaussian Bayesian models.

### Model justification

For our analysis, we use separate Bayesian regression models to estimate the infant death rates in states where abortion injunctions were implemented and in states where abortion remains legal. We use the interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal to measure the causal effect of the abortion injunction. Both models share the same predictors to ensure consistency and comparability in capturing the determinants of infant mortality.

For one of our models, we include control variables (age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, and year_of_death) to adjust for confounders that could influence infant death rates, addressing the assumption of compositional differences in the DID approach and ensuring unbiased estimates of the intervention’s effect. In the other model, we exclude these controls to focus on the overall intervention impact, avoid overfitting, and prioritize simplicity when variability is adequately accounted for by the design or random effects. Thus, our decision to fit two models is to compare the outcomes: one adjusts for confounders to refine the estimates, while the other focuses on the direct effect of the intervention.

Our model includes state as a random effect to account for regional variations in infant mortality that could introduce bias. We use a random effect rather than a fixed effect to capture variability across states without estimating specific effects for each one. This approach models unobserved heterogeneity, such as differences in healthcare systems and socioeconomic conditions, using a single variance term, which avoids overfitting and ensures efficiency and generalizability. By adjusting for unmeasured state-specific factors, the model provides robust and reliable findings while balancing parsimony and interpretability, making it well-suited for our analysis.

We choose the Bayesian framework since it enhances the DID approach by incorporating prior information and quantifying uncertainty in a probabilistic manner. In our Bayesian models, we use weakly informative priors from the rstanarm package, including a Normal prior ($\mu=0$ and $\sigma=2.5$) for fixed effects and an Exponential prior (rate = 1) for the auxiliary parameter, with autoscale=TRUE to dynamically adjust priors based on data scale. This enhances convergence and ensures priors are calibrated to predictor ranges without dominating the data. The model assumes plausible parameter centering, random effects capture unobserved heterogeneity, and the DID framework relies on parallel trends between groups. However, limitations include potential bias from misspecified priors, computational challenges for hierarchical models, and sensitivity to data sparsity or imbalances. This model may not be suitable if group-level effects are negligible, parallel trends are violated, or data is insufficient, but when applied appropriately, it provides robust and interpretable causal estimates.

The results from the two Bayesian models are summarized in @tbl-modelresults. The interaction term between after_injunction and abortion_illegal is positive and statistically significant (0.111 in Model 1 and 0.280 in Model 2), indicating a change in infant mortality rates associated with the combination of abortion bans and the post-injunction period.

For the independent effects, states where abortion is illegal show higher infant mortality rates, with coefficients of 3.365 in Model 1 and 1.400 in Model 2. The post-injunction period alone is associated with coefficients of -0.525 in Model 1 and -0.940 in Model 2, indicating a decrease in infant mortality during this time.

Demographic variables also exhibit notable associations. Maternal age is negatively associated with infant mortality, with coefficients for age groups 25–29 and 30–34 of -5.73 and -6.15 in Model 2, respectively. The coefficient for Black mothers in Model 2 is 6.66, reflecting higher infant mortality compared to other racial groups.

The models performed well, with low RMSE values and high $R^2$ values, indicating that the predictors account for a substantial portion of the variance in infant mortality rates. 

# Discussion

## Key Findings and Implications

The analysis reveals distinct patterns in infant mortality rates across various policy and demographic factors. In states where abortion remained legal, the post-injunction period (after_injunction1) is linked to reductions in infant mortality rates by 0.525 and 0.940 deaths per 1,000 live births in Models 1 and 2, respectively. However, states with abortion bans (abortion_illegal1) exhibit significantly higher infant mortality rates, with increases of 3.365 deaths in Model 1 and 1.400 deaths in Model 2. The DID interaction term (after_injunction1 × abortion_illegal1) reveals that abortion bans during the post-injunction period result in an additional increase of 0.111 deaths in Model 1 and 0.280 deaths in Model 2. Demographic factors also play a critical role, with older maternal age (25–34 years) reducing infant mortality rates, while younger mothers (15–19 years) face elevated risks. Black mothers experience disproportionately higher infant mortality rates, with an increase of 6.660 deaths per 1,000 live births compared to Asian mothers. These findings collectively emphasize the compounded effects of policy and demographic disparities on infant health outcomes.

## Public Health Implications of Restrictive Abortion Laws

The findings highlight the significant public health consequences of abortion bans in the United States. The observed increase of 0.285 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in states enforcing abortion bans after the Dobbs decision underscores the detrimental impact of restrictive abortion policies. These increases often reflect systemic issues such as inadequate prenatal care, gaps in healthcare access, and underlying socioeconomic inequities. States with pre-existing healthcare challenges may experience amplified effects, suggesting an urgent need for comprehensive policy interventions to address these disparities. Tackling the root causes of these health disparities—such as improving prenatal care, expanding healthcare access, and addressing socioeconomic inequalities—will be essential for mitigating the unintended consequences of restrictive abortion legislation.

## Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities

The results reveal stark racial disparities in infant mortality rates, with Black mothers experiencing significantly higher rates compared to other racial groups. These disparities are exacerbated by restrictive abortion policies, which disproportionately affect already vulnerable populations. The intersection of systemic healthcare inequities, socioeconomic challenges, and restrictive legislation creates compounded risks for marginalized communities, leading to worse health outcomes. Addressing these inequities requires targeted policies that ensure equitable access to maternal and infant healthcare, particularly in communities most impacted by these disparities. Such policies should prioritize investments in healthcare infrastructure, culturally competent care, and programs that support at-risk populations.

## Integration of Policy and Healthcare Systems

The significant interaction between abortion legality and the post-injunction period illustrates the compounded impact of restrictive abortion policies on infant mortality rates. These findings underscore the need for integrated healthcare systems that can address the consequences of high-risk pregnancies, improve prenatal care, and ensure equitable access to medical services. Policymakers must consider the broader public health implications of abortion bans and implement strategies that safeguard maternal and infant health. This includes enhancing healthcare delivery in underserved areas, investing in community-based interventions, and ensuring that restrictive policies are accompanied by measures to mitigate their public health impact.

## Data and Temporal Limitations

A key limitation of our analysis is the temporal and demographic scope of the dataset. The data includes only infant deaths under 1 year of age occurring within the United States to U.S. residents during 2021–2022. This timeframe does not capture the full year of infant mortality outcomes following the Dobbs decision, as infants who died in 2023 are not included. Furthermore, the dataset’s focus on infants under 1 year of age may exclude cases that reflect longer-term health impacts. These limitations could lead to an underestimation of the full effects of abortion bans. Future research should incorporate more comprehensive and updated datasets to provide a clearer and more complete analysis of the long-term trends and implications of restrictive abortion policies.

## Weaknesses and Future Directions

While this study provides valuable findings, several limitations should be addressed in future research. The analysis relies on aggregate state-level data, which may obscure localized effects and intra-state disparities. Unmeasured confounders, such as economic conditions, healthcare infrastructure differences, or state-specific policies, could also influence the results. Moreover, the short timeframe of the dataset limits the ability to assess the long-term effects of abortion policies. Future research should integrate more granular data, such as county-level analyses, and extend the study period to capture longer-term impacts. Qualitative studies focusing on the lived experiences of affected populations can complement quantitative analyses, offering a deeper understanding of the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws. These efforts will support the development of evidence-based policies aimed at reducing disparities and improving maternal and infant health outcomes.

Bias, Risks, and Limitations
This model leverages observational data from the CDC WONDER dataset and applies a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach to analyze the impact of restrictive abortion policies on infant mortality rates. While the model provides valuable insights, several limitations and biases must be acknowledged:

Data Bias: The dataset is subject to selection bias due to the exclusion of certain demographic groups or states with incomplete data. This may lead to underrepresentation of specific populations, affecting the generalizability of findings.
Sociotechnical Bias: The results might reflect systemic healthcare inequities or societal disparities, particularly for marginalized groups such as Black mothers who face disproportionately higher infant mortality rates.
Assumption Dependence: The validity of the DID approach hinges on the parallel trends assumption. If unobserved factors disrupt this assumption, the causal inferences could be biased.
Temporal Limitations: The dataset covers only 2021–2022, excluding longer-term impacts of the Dobbs decision. Events or policy changes outside this timeframe might influence the results.
Ethical Risks: Potential misuse of this model in justifying restrictive abortion policies could exacerbate public health inequities instead of addressing them.
Recommendations
Awareness: Users must be informed of the dataset's limitations and biases, particularly in representing vulnerable populations.
Caution in Application: The model should not be used for individual predictions or decision-making without considering broader socioeconomic and healthcare contexts.
Future Research: Extending the analysis to more comprehensive datasets and incorporating qualitative data could address some limitations and provide a fuller understanding of the long-term effects.

Example Placement in the Model Card
## Technical Specifications

### Model Architecture and Objective
The model is a hierarchical Bayesian regression framework designed to assess the impact of abortion restrictions on infant mortality rates across U.S. states. The setup includes two models:
1. A baseline model to estimate direct and interaction effects.
2. An extended model incorporating demographic and temporal controls.

### Mathematical Model Setup
The models are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_i|\mu_i,\sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma)\\
\text{First Model}: \mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction} + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}\\&+\beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i+\gamma_j\\
\text{Second Model}:\mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+ \beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i\\&+\beta_4\cdot\text{Year of Death}_i+\beta_5\cdot\text{Age of Mother}_i+\beta_6\cdot\text{Mother's Single Race}_i+\gamma_j\\
\beta_0 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_1 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_2 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_3 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_4 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_5 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\beta_6 &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5)\\
\gamma_j&\sim \text{Normal}(0, \sigma_j^2)\\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{aligned}
$$

### Justification for the Model
The model incorporates:
- **Interaction Terms**: Capturing the combined effects of time and policy changes on infant mortality.
- **Random Effects**: Adjusting for unobserved heterogeneity across states.
- **Demographic and Temporal Controls**: Ensuring robust estimates that account for maternal age, race, and year of death.

This approach leverages Difference-in-Differences (DID) to isolate causal effects while quantifying uncertainty through Bayesian inference.

### Compute Infrastructure
The models were implemented using the `rstanarm` package in R, leveraging its default priors for both Gaussian and hierarchical Bayesian models.
By placing it in Technical Specifications, the content aligns with the expectations of advanced users and researchers who want a deeper understanding of the model's internal workings.

what should we do in ## How to Get Started with the Model if we have two models?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you have two models, you should clearly explain how to get started with each of them while highlighting their distinct purposes and use cases. Here’s how you can approach the How to Get Started with the Model section in the model card:

How to Get Started with the Model
Model Overview
First Model: A baseline model estimating direct and interaction effects of abortion legality and the post-injunction period on infant mortality rates.
Second Model: An extended model incorporating additional demographic and temporal controls (maternal age, race, year of death) for deeper analysis.
Code Examples
Provide code snippets for initializing, loading, and running both models.

Loading the Models
Explain how users can access the pre-trained models (e.g., from a repository, file, or cloud storage).
# Load the first model (Baseline)
first_model <- readRDS("path/to/first_model.rds")

# Load the second model (Extended)
second_model <- readRDS("path/to/second_model.rds")
Using the Models for Prediction
Demonstrate how to use each model to make predictions or run evaluations. If the models are Bayesian, include posterior summaries or predictive checks.
# Generate predictions using the first model
first_predictions <- posterior_predict(first_model, newdata = data)

# Generate predictions using the second model
second_predictions <- posterior_predict(second_model, newdata = data)
Comparing the Models Show how to compare the outputs of both models to analyze differences.
# Compare predictions from both models
comparison <- data.frame(
  First_Model = apply(first_predictions, 2, mean),
  Second_Model = apply(second_predictions, 2, mean)
)

print(comparison)
Visualizing Results If appropriate, include visualizations for users to interpret results.
library(ggplot2)

# Visualize predictions from both models
ggplot(comparison, aes(x = First_Model, y = Second_Model)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Predictions",
       x = "First Model Predictions",
       y = "Second Model Predictions") +
  theme_minimal()
Key Differences in Use Cases Explain when to use each model:
First Model: For a simpler analysis focusing on direct and interaction effects.
Second Model: For detailed analysis accounting for demographic and temporal variability.
Dependencies
Clearly specify software dependencies for both models. For example:

- **Required Libraries:** `rstanarm`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- **Data Format:** Ensure input data includes columns: `after_injunction`, `abortion_illegal`, `age_of_mother`, `mothers_single_race`, and `year_of_death`.
By structuring the section this way, you provide clear, actionable steps for users to engage with both models while differentiating their purposes. This ensures users can use the models effectively without confusion.

# Model Card for Infant Mortality and Abortion Legality Models

<!-- Provide a quick summary of what the model is/does. -->

This repository includes two Bayesian Difference-in-Differences (DID) models that examine the impact of abortion legality and demographic factors on infant mortality rates in the United States post the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision. The models analyze the interaction of state-level abortion legality and the timing of policy changes to evaluate their effects on infant mortality.

## Model Details

### Model Description

<!-- Provide a longer summary of what this model is. -->

The two models analyze infant mortality rates using state-level data from the CDC Wonder dataset (2017–2022). They assess the causal impact of abortion injunctions by comparing infant mortality trends in states where abortion became illegal versus states where it remained legal after the Dobbs decision. The first model focuses on a baseline analysis of policy interactions, while the second model incorporates additional controls for maternal demographic factors.

## Uses

### Direct Use

These models are intended for use in analyzing the impact of abortion restrictions on public health outcomes, particularly infant mortality rates. The first model is ideal for basic policy impact analysis, while the second model provides more detailed insights into demographic disparities.

### Downstream Use [optional]

The models can be adapted for further research into healthcare policy, demographic disparities, or longitudinal public health analyses.

### Out-of-Scope Use

These models should not be used for predicting individual-level outcomes or in contexts where data availability or quality does not meet the standards used in this analysis.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

The models rely on observational data and assume parallel trends in the absence of intervention. Limitations include potential unmeasured confounders and variability in state-level healthcare systems. Results are not generalizable outside the studied demographic and temporal scope.

### Recommendations

Users should carefully evaluate data quality and consider additional controls for unobserved variables when adapting these models to other contexts.

## How to Get Started with the Model

#### Loading the Models

```r
# Load the models
first_model <- readRDS("path/to/first_model.rds")
second_model <- readRDS("path/to/second_model.rds")
Generating Predictions

Comparing Outputs
# Compare predictions
comparison <- data.frame(
  First_Model = apply(first_predictions, 2, mean),
  Second_Model = apply(second_predictions, 2, mean)
)
Training Details
Training Data
The models use state-level data on infant mortality from the CDC Wonder dataset (2017–2022), specifically the "Linked Birth/Infant Death Records (Expanded)" dataset.

Training Procedure
The models were trained using the rstanarm package in R, leveraging weakly informative priors and adjusting for state-level random effects. Training used an Exponential prior for variance and Normal priors for fixed effects.

Training Hyperparameters
Priors: Normal(0, 2.5) for fixed effects, Exponential(1) for variance
Iterations: 2000
Chains: 4
Evaluation
Testing Data, Factors & Metrics
The models were evaluated on their ability to capture trends in infant mortality rates across states, with a focus on differences between legal and illegal abortion states post the Dobbs decision.

Metrics
Posterior Predictive Checks
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
$R^2$ for model fit
Summary
The models successfully capture demographic disparities and the impact of abortion injunctions, demonstrating robustness in parallel trends assumptions.

Environmental Impact
The training process used local hardware and had minimal environmental impact due to the modest computational requirements of Bayesian regression.

Your code snippet includes both a stan_glmer Bayesian model setup and a REST API endpoint for a predictive model using plumber. Here’s how the different parts align and can be structured into your project documentation, particularly for the Model Card:

Integration into the Model Card
Model Details

The stan_glmer section should be used to describe the model architecture and training setup.
Explain the formula used (death_rate ~ after_injunction * abortion_illegal + abortion_illegal + (1 | state)), the priors, and the model's hierarchical nature.
How to Get Started with the Model

Include an example of loading the model (first_model) and making predictions directly.
Additional Use Case: API Integration

Use the REST API code snippet (predict_sleep) as an example of operationalizing the model in a web application or service.
Mention how users can send input data (e.g., afternoon_nap_length) to get predictions.
Revised Model Card Section: API Integration
How to Get Started with the Model

You can interact with the model directly or via an API for predictions. Below is an example of setting up a REST API using plumber.

API Endpoint for Predictions
This API endpoint demonstrates how to use a predictive model in a web application.

# Load required libraries
library(plumber)

# Define the API
#* @param afternoon_nap_length Length of the afternoon nap in minutes.
#* @get /predict_death_rate
predict_death_rate <- function(after_injunction = 0, abortion_illegal = 0) {
  input_data <- data.frame(
    after_injunction = as.integer(after_injunction),
    abortion_illegal = as.integer(abortion_illegal)
  )
  
  # Generate predictions
  prediction <- predict(first_model, newdata = input_data)
  
  list(
    input = input_data,
    prediction = prediction,
    status = 200
  )
}

# Run the API
pr <- plumber::plumb("path_to_file.R")
pr$run(port = 8000)
Example API Call
You can make predictions by sending a GET request to the /predict_death_rate endpoint. Example:

GET http://localhost:8000/predict_death_rate?after_injunction=1&abortion_illegal=1
Response:

{
  "input": {
    "after_injunction": 1,
    "abortion_illegal": 1
  },
  "prediction": [8.345],
  "status": 200
}
This API setup provides an interface for users to query the model predictions programmatically, making it suitable for integration into web services or applications.

Here is a variable list for your model based on the stan_glmer formula and the context of your analysis:

variables <- list(
  death_rate = "The number of deaths per 1,000 live births, a continuous variable.",
  after_injunction = "A binary variable indicating whether the infant's death occurred after the implementation of abortion injunctions (1 = Yes, 0 = No).",
  abortion_illegal = "A binary variable indicating the legality of abortion in the state of the mother's residence (1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal).",
  state = "The state of the mother's residence, included as a random effect in the model.",
  year_of_death = "The calendar year in which the infant's death occurred, ranging from 2021 to 2022.",
  age_of_mother = "The age group of the mother at the time of childbirth, categorized into brackets such as 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, and 30-34 years.",
  mothers_single_race = "The self-identified race of the mother, recorded as a categorical variable (e.g., Asian, Black or African American, White)."
)
Explanation:
death_rate: The dependent variable, representing the outcome of interest.
after_injunction and abortion_illegal: Key predictors and their interaction term are central to the analysis.
state: A random effect accounting for state-level variability.
Demographics (year_of_death, age_of_mother, mothers_single_race): Control variables to adjust for potential confounders.
You can add this list to your documentation or use it in an API to provide users with descriptions of the input and output variables.

Here's the function setup and variables specific to your first_model:

# List of variables
variables <- list(
  death_rate = "The number of deaths per 1,000 live births, a continuous variable.",
  after_injunction = "A binary variable indicating whether the infant's death occurred after the implementation of abortion injunctions (1 = Yes, 0 = No).",
  abortion_illegal = "A binary variable indicating the legality of abortion in the state of the mother's residence (1 = Illegal, 0 = Legal).",
  state = "The state of the mother's residence, included as a random effect in the model."
)

# Prediction function
predict_infant_death_rate <- function(after_injunction = 0, abortion_illegal = 0, state = "unknown") {
  # Create payload based on input
  payload <- data.frame(
    after_injunction = as.integer(after_injunction),
    abortion_illegal = as.integer(abortion_illegal),
    state = as.factor(state)
  )
  
  # Ensure input state matches model levels
  if (!state %in% levels(model$data$state)) {
    stop("State not recognized. Please provide a valid state.")
  }
  
  # Make prediction
  prediction <- predict(first_model, payload)
  
  # Return results
  result <- list(
    input = list(payload),
    response = list("estimated_death_rate" = prediction),
    status = 200,
    model_version = "1.0.0"
  )
  
  return(result)
}
Explanation:
variables: Descriptions of the variables used in the first_model. Adjust these descriptions as necessary to match your domain-specific terminology.
predict_infant_death_rate function:
Inputs include after_injunction, abortion_illegal, and state.
Validates that the state exists in the model's data levels.
Uses the model (first_model) to predict the death_rate based on the inputs.
Outputs a list with the input data, the estimated death_rate, and a status code.
You can integrate this into an API or use it directly in your R environment to interact with the model.

To deploy your plumber API using Amazon Web Services (AWS), you can follow these summarized steps from the referenced guide. This will allow you to make your API publicly accessible through AWS.

Step 1: Install AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
Download & Install: Visit the AWS CLI installation guide.
Configure AWS CLI: Run the following command and enter your AWS credentials:
aws configure
Provide your:
Access Key ID
Secret Access Key
Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
Output format (e.g., json)
Step 2: Set Up an EC2 Instance
Log in to the AWS Console and navigate to EC2.
Launch an Instance:
Choose Amazon Linux 2 or Ubuntu as the base image.
Select an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free tier).
Configure security groups:
Allow inbound traffic on port 8000 (for your API).
Add a key pair for SSH access.
Connect to the Instance:
Use your terminal and SSH into the instance:
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<public-ip>
Step 3: Install Dependencies on the Instance
Run the following commands to set up your environment:

# Update package manager
sudo yum update -y

# Install R and required tools
sudo amazon-linux-extras enable R3.4
sudo yum install -y R git

# Install Plumber and R dependencies
R -e "install.packages(c('plumber', 'jsonlite'))"

# Install Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
sudo yum install -y docker
sudo service docker start
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
Step 4: Upload Your API Code
SCP (Secure Copy) Your API Script to the Instance:
scp -i /path/to/your-key.pem api.R ec2-user@<public-ip>:~/
Run the Plumber API:
Rscript -e "pr <- plumber::plumb('api.R'); pr$run(host = '0.0.0.0', port = 8000)"
Verify: Access the API in your browser or via curl:
http://<public-ip>:8000/predict_death_rate?after_injunction=1&abortion_illegal=1&state=Texas
Step 5: Automate the API with a Service
To keep the API running after you log out:

Install screen:
sudo yum install -y screen
Run the API in a Detached Screen:
screen -S plumber-api
Rscript -e "pr <- plumber::plumb('api.R'); pr$run(host = '0.0.0.0', port = 8000)"
Detach from the screen using Ctrl + A, D. Reattach using:
screen -r plumber-api
Step 6: Secure and Scale
Set Up HTTPS: Use a load balancer or AWS Certificate Manager for SSL/TLS.
Scaling:
Use AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) to distribute traffic.
Enable Auto Scaling for higher availability.
Step 7: Monitor and Optimize
CloudWatch: Set up monitoring for API performance.
Billing Dashboard: Monitor usage costs if using non-free-tier instances.
This process sets up and deploys your plumber API on AWS, allowing you to share it securely with end users. Let me know if you'd like help with any of these steps in more detail!







You said:
This set-up process will take some time, but we only need to do it once. Two additional packages that will assist here are plumberDeploy (Allen 2021) and analogsea (Chamberlain et al. 2022) (which will need to be installed from GitHub: install_github("sckott/analogsea")).
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The setup process indeed requires some effort initially, but using packages like plumberDeploy and analogsea can significantly simplify the deployment process, especially if you're using DigitalOcean instead of AWS. Here's a breakdown of how these tools can assist:

Installing Necessary Packages
To proceed with deployment using plumberDeploy and analogsea, you'll first need to install them:

Install the plumberDeploy package from CRAN:
install.packages("plumberDeploy")
Install the analogsea package from GitHub:
remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
This package is specifically designed to interact with DigitalOcean's API, making it easier to create, manage, and deploy droplets (DigitalOcean's virtual machines).
Step-by-Step Deployment Using DigitalOcean
1. Set Up a DigitalOcean Account
Create a DigitalOcean account and get your API token from the API tokens page.
2. Create a Droplet with Analogsea
Use the analogsea package to spin up a new droplet:

library(analogsea)

# Authenticate with your DigitalOcean API token
do_token("your_api_token")

# Create a new droplet
droplet <- droplet_create(name = "plumber-api-droplet")
print(droplet)
This creates a virtual machine on DigitalOcean, pre-installed with R, and ready for deployment.

3. Deploy Your Plumber API with PlumberDeploy
Use the plumberDeploy package to deploy your API to the droplet:

library(plumberDeploy)

# Deploy your plumber API
do_deploy_api(
  droplet = droplet,
  path = "path_to_your_api.R",  # Replace with the path to your Plumber script
  name = "my-plumber-api"
)
The do_deploy_api function handles the installation of R, Plumber, and other required dependencies on the droplet.

4. Access the API
Once the deployment is complete, you can access your API using the droplet's public IP address:

http://<droplet-ip>:8000/endpoint
Replace <droplet-ip> with the actual IP address of your droplet.

Why Use These Packages?
Simplifies Configuration:

plumberDeploy automates the setup of Plumber on your server.
analogsea provides an R interface for creating and managing droplets on DigitalOcean.
Reusable Setup:

Once configured, the server can host multiple Plumber APIs without needing reconfiguration.
Minimal Manual Intervention:

Automates server configuration, package installation, and API hosting.
Key Notes
Costs: DigitalOcean droplets are billed hourly or monthly. For small projects, a $5/month droplet is usually sufficient.
One-Time Setup: After setting up your server, deploying future APIs becomes a matter of running a few commands.
Documentation: Refer to the plumberDeploy documentation for more examples.

Run the following to clean your environment:
rm(list = ls())
gc()
2. Update Your Packages
Ensure that all existing packages are updated:

update.packages(ask = FALSE)
3. Reinstall pkgbuild
pkgbuild is a dependency of remotes and devtools. Reinstall it manually:

install.packages("pkgbuild")
4. Remove Corrupted Files
Manually delete the lazy-load database file that is causing the issue:

Locate the corrupted file:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library/pkgbuild/R/pkgbuild.rdb
Navigate to the directory and delete the file pkgbuild.rdb and associated pkgbuild.rdx.
Alternatively, you can reinstall the package:
remove.packages("pkgbuild")
install.packages("pkgbuild")
5. Reinstall analogsea
Once the environment is clean, try reinstalling analogsea:

remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
6. Check for System Dependencies
Ensure that required system dependencies for building packages from source are installed. On macOS:

Install Xcode Command Line Tools:
xcode-select --install
Update Homebrew and required libraries:
brew update
brew install openssl libgit2
7. Debugging Installation
If the above fails, use verbose output to debug:

options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org/"))
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS = "true")
remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea", force = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
8. Clear Your Cache
Clear cached downloads in case of partial or corrupted downloads:

unlink("~/.R/packrat/lib", recursive = TRUE)
If these steps don’t resolve the issue, let me know, and we can explore deeper system-level troubleshooting!

The error suggests that the lazy-load database for the pkgbuild package is corrupted. Here’s how to resolve the issue:

Step 1: Restart R
Quit and restart R or RStudio to clear the session.
Remove any loaded packages and clear memory:
rm(list = ls())
gc()
Step 2: Remove the Corrupted Package
Delete the corrupted pkgbuild package manually:

Locate the pkgbuild directory:
/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library/pkgbuild/
Delete the entire pkgbuild directory. You can do this via Finder or Terminal:
rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library/pkgbuild
Step 3: Reinstall pkgbuild
Reinstall the pkgbuild package:

install.packages("pkgbuild")
Step 4: Reinstall analogsea
After reinstalling pkgbuild, install analogsea from GitHub:

remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
Step 5: Address Potential System-Level Issues
Update Xcode Command Line Tools (macOS)

xcode-select --install
Ensure You Have Build Tools
For macOS, you need Homebrew and required libraries:

Install or update Homebrew:
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew update
Install required dependencies:
brew install openssl libgit2
Set Environment Variables for Compilers
If you continue to experience build issues, set the paths explicitly in R:

Sys.setenv(PATH = paste("/usr/local/bin", Sys.getenv("PATH"), sep = ":"))
Step 6: Debug the Installation Process
To capture additional error information, run the installation with verbose output:

remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea", force = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)
Step 7: Clear Cache

Using github PAT from envvar GITHUB_TOKEN. Use gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and unset GITHUB_TOKEN in .Renviron (or elsewhere) if you want to use the more secure git credential store instead.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The message indicates that your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is being retrieved from the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable, which is less secure than using the git credential store. Here’s how to resolve it:

Option 1: Use gitcreds for Secure Credential Management
Install and Load gitcreds (if not already installed):

install.packages("gitcreds")
library(gitcreds)
Set Up a GitHub Token Using gitcreds: Run the following command to store your GitHub PAT securely:

gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
When prompted, paste your GitHub PAT (if you don't have one, generate one here).
Ensure the token has the necessary scopes, such as repo, read:org, or others required for your tasks.
Unset the GITHUB_TOKEN Environment Variable:

Open your .Renviron file:
usethis::edit_r_environ()
Remove or comment out the line containing GITHUB_TOKEN:
# GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
Save and restart your R session.
Option 2: Keep GITHUB_TOKEN but Understand Its Limitations
If you prefer to keep using GITHUB_TOKEN:

Verify its permissions and ensure it’s stored securely.
Avoid exposing the token in shared environments or scripts.
Additional Notes
Why Use gitcreds?

It leverages your system’s credential store, which is more secure than storing sensitive data in plain text files or environment variables.
To View Current Stored Credentials: Run:

gitcreds::gitcreds_list()
To Clear Stored Credentials: Run:

gitcreds::gitcreds_delete()
By following Option 1, you’ll ensure that your GitHub PAT is managed securely, and you’ll avoid the warning message in the future.

Now we need to connect the local computer with the DigitalOcean account.

account()

Now we need to authenticate the connection, and this is done using a SSH public key.

key_create()

What you want is to have a “.pub” file on our computer. Then copy the public key aspect in that file, and add it to the SSH keys section in the account security settings. When we have the key on our local computer, then we can check this using ssh.

ssh_key_info()

Again, this will all take a while to validate. DigitalOcean calls every computer that we start a “droplet”. If we start three computers, then we will have started three droplets. We can check the droplets that are running.

droplets()

If everything is set up properly, then this will print the information about all droplets that you have associated with the account (which at this point, is probably none). We must first create a droplet.

id <- do_provision(example = FALSE)

Then we get asked for the SSH passphrase and then it will set up a bunch of things. After this we are going to need to install a whole bunch of things onto our droplet.

install_r_package(
  droplet = id,
  c(
    "plumber",
    "remotes",
    "here"
  )
)

debian_apt_get_install(
  id,
  "libssl-dev",
  "libsodium-dev",
  "libcurl4-openssl-dev"
)

debian_apt_get_install(
  id,
  "libxml2-dev"
)

install_r_package(
  id,
  c(
    "config",
    "httr",
    "urltools",
    "plumber"
  )
)

install_r_package(id, c("xml2"))
install_r_package(id, c("tidyverse"))
install_r_package(id, c("tidymodels"))

And then when that is finally set up (it will take 30 minutes or so) we can deploy our API.

do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,

The provided instructions walk you through the process of deploying an R API to a DigitalOcean droplet using the plumberDeploy and analogsea R packages. Here’s a step-by-step guide to ensure success:

Step 1: Connect Your Local Computer with DigitalOcean
Authenticate the Connection
Ensure analogsea and dependencies are installed:

install.packages("analogsea")
library(analogsea)
Connect to DigitalOcean:

account()
Step 2: Generate and Use SSH Keys
Create a New SSH Key
Generate an SSH Key:

key_create()
A .pub file will be created in your .ssh directory.
Add the Key to DigitalOcean:

Log in to your DigitalOcean account.
Go to Settings > Security > Add SSH Key.
Paste the public key from your .pub file into the provided field.
Verify the Key:

ssh_key_info()
Step 3: Check Droplets
List Existing Droplets:

droplets()
If none exist, proceed to the next step to create one.
Create a New Droplet:

id <- do_provision(example = FALSE)
You’ll be prompted for the SSH passphrase you set during key generation.
Step 4: Install Necessary Software on the Droplet
Once the droplet is provisioned, install R packages and system dependencies:

Install R Packages:

install_r_package(
  droplet = id,
  c("plumber", "remotes", "here")
)
Install System Dependencies:

debian_apt_get_install(
  id,
  "libssl-dev", "libsodium-dev", "libcurl4-openssl-dev"
)
debian_apt_get_install(
  id,
  "libxml2-dev"
)
Install Additional R Packages:

install_r_package(id, c("config", "httr", "urltools", "plumber"))
install_r_package(id, c("xml2"))
install_r_package(id, c("tidyverse"))
install_r_package(id, c("tidymodels"))
Step 5: Deploy the API
Once the droplet is ready, deploy your API:

Deploy the API:

do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
Access Your API:

Open a web browser and go to http://<droplet-ip>:8000/__docs__ to view the API documentation.
Notes and Tips
Timing:

Setting up the droplet and installing dependencies may take up to 30 minutes or longer.
Droplet Access:

You can SSH into your droplet using:
ssh root@<droplet-ip>
Secure Your Droplet:

After deployment, ensure your droplet is secured (e.g., disable root login, enable a firewall).
Monitor Deployment:

Use logs to monitor deployment issues:
droplet_logs(id)
By following these steps, you’ll have a deployed R API running on DigitalOcean.

key_create()
Error in key_create() : argument "name" is missing, with no default
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The key_create() function requires a name for the SSH key as an argument. This name will help you identify the key when you manage it later. Here’s how you can use the function properly:

Correct Usage of key_create()
library(analogsea)

# Create an SSH key with a name, e.g., "my-droplet-key"
key_create(name = "my-droplet-key")
Additional Notes:
The name parameter is a string that will label the key in your DigitalOcean account.
After running this command, the function will generate an SSH key and save it to your .ssh directory.
Troubleshooting:
Ensure analogsea is loaded:
library(analogsea)
Check for Permission Issues: Ensure that R has permission to write to your .ssh directory.
Verify Existing Keys: If you already have a key, you can list it using:
ssh_key_info()
This should resolve the error and allow you to generate the key successfully.







You said:
key_create(name = "my-droplet-key")
Error in key_create(name = "my-droplet-key") : 
  argument "public_key" is missing, with no default
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The key_create() function in the analogsea package also requires a public_key argument. This argument specifies the path to the public key file that you want to upload to DigitalOcean.

Here's how you can resolve the issue:

Steps to Create and Use an SSH Key for key_create()
Generate an SSH Key (if you don't already have one): Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts to create the key. By default, it will save the private key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa and the public key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.

Provide the Public Key to key_create(): Use the path to the .pub file you generated. For example:

library(analogsea)

key_create(name = "my-droplet-key", public_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
Check If the Key Exists: After creating the key, you can check if it has been added:

ssh_key_info()
Additional Notes:
Ensure the .pub file exists: The public_key argument requires a valid public key file.
SSH Key Path: Adjust the file path if your key is not in the default ~/.ssh/ directory.
Manage Keys in DigitalOcean: You can verify the uploaded key in your DigitalOcean account under the "Security" → "SSH Keys" section.
Let me know if you encounter further issues!

In addition: Warning message:
In file(con, "r") :
  cannot open file '/Users/shenxiner1/.ssh/id_rsa.pub': No such file or directory
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests that the public key file ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub doesn't exist or cannot be accessed at the specified path. Here's how to resolve it:

Step 1: Confirm Public Key Existence
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Check if the public key exists:
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If the file exists, it will display the path.
If it doesn't exist, you'll need to generate it.
Step 2: Generate an SSH Key (If Needed)
If the public key file is missing:

Generate a new SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
When prompted to "Enter file in which to save the key," press Enter to use the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa).
The public key will be saved as ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Verify that the key was created:

ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Step 3: Load the Public Key in R
Once you have confirmed that the file exists, use the following R code to create the SSH key in DigitalOcean:

library(analogsea)

# Replace with the correct path to your public key file
public_key_path <- "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

# Read the public key and create the key in DigitalOcean
if (file.exists(public_key_path)) {
  k <- key_create("key", readLines(public_key_path))
  print(k)
} else {
  stop("Public key file does not exist. Please check the path.")
}
Step 4: Verify Key Creation
After running the code, verify that the key was successfully added to DigitalOcean:

ssh_key_info()
Let me know if this resolves your issue!







You said:
id <- do_provision(example = FALSE)
Error in do_provision(example = FALSE) : 
  could not find function "do_provision"
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the do_provision() function is not found, likely because it comes from the analogsea package, which might not be properly installed or loaded.

Here’s how to fix this step by step:

Step 1: Ensure analogsea is Installed
Make sure the analogsea package is installed and loaded. Run:

if (!requireNamespace("analogsea", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("analogsea")
}
library(analogsea)
Step 2: Verify Package and Function Availability
Check if the do_provision function is available in the analogsea package:

ls("package:analogsea")
If do_provision doesn’t appear, it might be because the function is not part of your installed version of the analogsea package. You can try reinstalling it from GitHub:

remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
library(analogsea)
Step 3: Provision a Droplet with Alternative Commands
If do_provision() is not available, you can manually create a droplet using the droplet_create() function:

# Replace "ubuntu-22-04-x64" with your desired image
droplet <- droplet_create(
  name = "my-droplet",
  size = "s-1vcpu-1gb",
  region = "nyc3",
  image = "ubuntu-22-04-x64"
)

To execute these commands successfully, ensure that the droplet (id) is correctly set up and connected. Here’s a detailed guide for executing these steps:

1. Install R Packages on the Droplet
The install_r_package() function installs R packages directly on the droplet. Use it as follows:

install_r_package(
  droplet = id, # Replace 'id' with your droplet object
  c(
    "plumber",  # Framework for building REST APIs in R
    "remotes",  # Install R packages from GitHub
    "here"      # Simplifies file referencing
  )
)
2. Install Required System Dependencies
Use debian_apt_get_install() to install system dependencies. This ensures all libraries required for certain R packages are available:

debian_apt_get_install(
  droplet = id, # Replace 'id' with your droplet object
  c(
    "libssl-dev",         # Required for secure connections
    "libsodium-dev",      # For cryptographic functions
    "libcurl4-openssl-dev" # For HTTP requests
  )
)

# Install additional dependencies:
debian_apt_get_install(
  droplet = id,
  "libxml2-dev" # Required for XML parsing
)
3. Install Additional R Packages
Add more R packages to your droplet as needed:

Example:
# Configuration and API tools
install_r_package(
  droplet = id,
  c(
    "config",     # Configuration management
    "httr",       # HTTP client for R
    "urltools",   # URL parsing and manipulation
    "plumber"     # REST API framework
  )
)

# Data wrangling and modeling libraries
install_r_package(id, c("xml2"))         # XML parsing
install_r_package(id, c("tidyverse"))    # Data manipulation and visualization
install_r_package(id, c("tidymodels"))   # Machine learning
4. Verify Installation
To confirm successful installation, check the installed packages on the droplet:

debian_apt_get_list_installed(id)   # Lists system dependencies
rstudioapi::versionInfo()           # Check installed R version and packages
5. Handle Errors
If any errors occur, verify that:

The droplet is properly set up and accessible.
SSH access is correctly configured.
System resources (RAM, CPU) on the droplet are sufficient.
Next Steps:
Once these dependencies are installed, proceed to deploy your API using do_deploy_api(). Let me know if you need help with this step!

droplet cost my money, how can I end that without affecting my api?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To avoid unnecessary costs while keeping your API functional, you have a few options:

Option 1: Use Free or Low-Cost Alternatives
Instead of relying on a paid droplet, consider the following alternatives:

Run Locally: Deploy the API on your local machine using plumber and expose it via tools like ngrok, which provides public URLs for local applications.

Free Hosting Platforms:

Render
Heroku (limited free tier)
Fly.io
These platforms provide free tiers suitable for small-scale APIs.

Use Cloud Provider Free Tiers:

AWS Free Tier: Use AWS Lambda to host your API. Combine it with API Gateway for RESTful endpoints.
Google Cloud Free Tier: Deploy using Google Cloud Run for serverless API hosting.
Option 2: Suspend or Delete the Droplet
If you are certain you don’t need the droplet running, you can suspend or destroy it:

Suspend the Droplet:

Log in to your DigitalOcean account.
Navigate to the droplet.
Click Turn Off.
This stops the droplet but keeps it available for later use. Note that storage charges may still apply.
Destroy the Droplet:

If you no longer need the droplet, delete it entirely:
Navigate to the droplet in DigitalOcean.
Click Destroy in the settings.
Important: Ensure you have backed up your API code and any associated data before deletion.
Option 3: Keep the Droplet but Minimize Costs
Resize the Droplet:

Downgrade to the smallest instance size if your API doesn’t require high resources. Smaller droplets have lower costs.
Optimize Usage:

Configure the droplet to shut down during non-usage periods.
Use scripts or automation tools to turn it on/off based on demand.
Option 4: Transfer the API to Serverless Infrastructure
Migrate your API to a serverless architecture like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. Serverless platforms charge only for usage (e.g., API calls) instead of continuously running a server.

How to Migrate:

Package your plumber API code.
Deploy it as a serverless function.
Use tools like serverless or sam for deployment.

  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The do_deploy_api function deploys your API to the specified DigitalOcean droplet. Here's a step-by-step explanation and potential troubleshooting advice:

Understanding do_deploy_api Parameters
droplet: The identifier of the droplet where the API will be deployed. This must be created beforehand using a function like do_provision or similar.
path: The path on the droplet where the API will be deployed. In this case, "example" will likely create a directory named example on the droplet.
localPath: Specifies the local directory containing your API files. The getwd() function returns your current working directory.
port: The port on which the API will run on the droplet. Port 8000 is commonly used for development.
docs: Setting this to TRUE generates and serves interactive API documentation.
overwrite: If TRUE, it overwrites existing files in the specified droplet directory.
Before Running do_deploy_api
Droplet Created: Ensure you have successfully created a droplet (id) using a function like do_provision.
SSH Key Setup: Verify that your SSH key is correctly configured and added to your DigitalOcean account.
Packages Installed: Make sure necessary R packages like plumber and dependencies are installed on the droplet.
Executing the Deployment
Run the function:

do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
Post-Deployment Steps
Access the API:

Use the droplet's public IP address and the specified port (e.g., http://<droplet-ip>:8000).
If docs = TRUE, navigate to /__docs__/ to access the interactive documentation.
Testing:

Test your endpoints to ensure everything is functioning correctly.
Monitor Logs:

SSH into the droplet and check logs to debug potential issues:
sudo journalctl -u plumber
Common Errors and Fixes
Error: Droplet Not Found

Ensure the id variable references an active droplet. Use droplets() to list all active droplets.
Error: SSH Connection Issues

Check your SSH key configuration.
Ensure the public key is added to your DigitalOcean account.
Error: Missing Dependencies

Ensure all required R packages and system libraries are installed on the droplet. Use install_r_package or debian_apt_get_install to resolve this.
Port Already in Use:

Check if another process is using port 8000 on the droplet:
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8000
If occupied, use a different port in the do_deploy_api call.

The error message suggests an issue with setting up and starting your Plumber API as a systemd service on the remote droplet. To troubleshoot and resolve this:

Steps to Debug and Fix the Issue
Check Service Logs: Run the following command on the droplet to see detailed logs about why the service failed:

sudo journalctl -u plumber-example.service
This will give you information about what caused the status=1/FAILURE. Look for errors such as missing files, permissions issues, or configuration errors.

Verify the API File Paths: Ensure the paths to your API scripts (plumber.R and server.R) are correct and available on the droplet. You can do this by checking:

ls /Users/shenxiner1/Relationship\ between\ infant\ mortality\ rate\ and\ prohibited\ abortion/API/
If these files are not present on the droplet, you may need to re-upload them.

Inspect the Service File: Check the contents of the service file to ensure it points to the correct R script and configurations. Run:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
Verify the following:

The correct path to Rscript or R.
The correct path to your API files (e.g., plumber.R).
The service file might look like this:

[Unit]
Description=Plumber API
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/Rscript /path/to/your/plumber.R
Restart=on-failure
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/API
Environment="R_ENVIRON=/path/to/.Renviron"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Validate Permissions: Ensure the necessary permissions are set for the API directory and files:
sudo chmod +x /path/to/your/plumber.R
sudo chown -R root:root /path/to/your/API
Reload and Restart the Service: After making corrections to the service file or verifying file paths, reload the systemd configuration and restart the service:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
sudo systemctl status plumber-example.service
Inspect Port Availability: Ensure that the port specified in your API deployment (e.g., 8000) is available and not being used by another process:

sudo lsof -i -P -n | grep LISTEN
If another service is using the port, either stop it or change the port in your do_deploy_api configuration.

Check Nginx Configuration (Optional): If you are using Nginx to proxy the API, ensure that the configuration file exists and is valid:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/plumber-apis/example.conf
Reload Nginx to apply any changes:

sudo systemctl reload nginx
Re-Deploy API (if necessary): If issues persist, redeploy the API with:
do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
Stopping the Service and Droplet
If you no longer need the API, stop or delete the service and droplet to avoid incurring costs:

Stop the service:
sudo systemctl stop plumber-example.service
Stop or delete the droplet:
droplet_stop(id)
droplet_delete(id)
If you provide logs from journalctl, I can assist you further!

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error suggests an issue with the paths or permissions when attempting to set up or manage the Plumber API service. Let's address these systematically.

Key Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check the File Paths
The ls command failed due to incorrect escaping of spaces in the path. To verify the files are in the correct location, run the following command:

ls "/Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API/"
Ensure that the required plumber.R and server.R files exist in this directory.

2. Inspect Service Logs
Run the following command on the droplet to inspect detailed logs about the failure:

sudo journalctl -u plumber-example.service
Look for error messages about missing files, permissions, or other configuration issues.

3. Verify the Service File
Check the content of the service file to confirm it points to the correct paths for Rscript and your API files:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
It should look similar to this:

[Unit]
Description=Plumber API
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/Rscript /path/to/your/API/plumber.R
Restart=on-failure
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/API
Environment="R_ENVIRON=/path/to/.Renviron"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
If the paths or settings are incorrect, update them and save the file.

4. Validate Permissions
Ensure that the API files have the correct permissions and are executable by the service:

sudo chmod +x "/Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API/plumber.R"
sudo chmod +x "/Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API/server.R"
sudo chown -R root:root "/Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API/"
5. Restart the Service
After verifying and correcting any issues, reload the systemd configuration and restart the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
sudo systemctl status plumber-example.service
6. Test the API
If the service is running successfully, you can test the API using a browser or curl:

curl http://<your-droplet-ip>:8000/__docs__/
Replace <your-droplet-ip> with your droplet's public IP address.

If Issues Persist
If the nginx config is missing or incomplete, you may need to reconfigure or bypass it. For instance, directly expose the API on port 8000 instead of through nginx.
To redeploy the API, try the following in R:
do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = "/Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API",
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
Ensure the paths and droplet setup are correct before redeploying.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The command sudo nano is intended to be run on a Unix-based terminal (e.g., macOS or Linux). It appears you are entering this command in an R console or a similar interface that doesn't interpret Unix commands.

How to Proceed:
If You’re Working on a Local Unix Terminal:

Open your terminal (e.g., Terminal on macOS).
Enter the command directly:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
If You’re Using an RStudio Terminal:

Open the Terminal tab in RStudio (not the R Console).
Enter the same command:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
If You're Connecting to a Remote Droplet:

Use SSH to connect to your droplet:
ssh root@<your-droplet-ip>
Replace <your-droplet-ip> with the IP address of your droplet.
Once connected, run the command:
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
If You Only Have R Console Access:

You cannot run Unix commands like sudo nano directly in the R console.
Instead, use R’s system command to execute Unix commands:
system("sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service")
However, this may prompt for a password in a way that’s difficult to handle in R. Using the terminal is strongly recommended.

The issue lies in the failed deployment of your Plumber API service on the remote droplet. The error indicates that the service configuration (plumber-example.service) is failing, likely due to incorrect paths, permissions, or dependencies.

Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve this:

1. Check Logs for Errors
The error message suggests the service is failing to start. View the detailed logs using:

journalctl -u plumber-example.service
This will show why the service failed to start. Look for errors related to paths, permissions, or missing dependencies.

2. Ensure Correct File Paths
The paths /Users/shenxiner1/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API/ are from your local machine and are being referenced on the remote droplet. Update the service file to point to the correct location of the API on the droplet.

Open the service file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
Ensure the ExecStart path is correct, for example:

ExecStart=/usr/bin/Rscript /path/to/api/plumber.R
3. Test Manually
Before deploying the service:

SSH into the droplet.
Manually test running the API:
Rscript /path/to/api/plumber.R
Ensure the API runs successfully without errors.
4. Verify Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are installed on the droplet. You might need to re-run:

install_r_package(
  id,
  c(
    "plumber",
    "remotes",
    "here",
    "config",
    "httr",
    "urltools",
    "tidyverse",
    "tidymodels",
    "xml2"
  )
)
And install required system libraries:

debian_apt_get_install(
  id,
  "libssl-dev",
  "libsodium-dev",
  "libcurl4-openssl-dev",
  "libxml2-dev"
)
5. Redeploy the Service
Once you’ve fixed the paths and dependencies:

Reload the systemd daemon:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart the service:
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
Check the status:
sudo systemctl status plumber-example.service
6. Alternative: Use plumberDeploy
The error also indicates do_deploy_api() is deprecated. Use plumberDeploy::do_deploy_api() instead:

plumberDeploy::do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
7. Stop Droplet to Avoid Costs
Once debugging is complete, you can stop the droplet to avoid additional costs:

do_droplet_delete(id)

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the path /path/to/api/plumber.R does not exist. You need to replace /path/to/api/plumber.R with the actual path to the plumber.R file on your remote droplet, not your local machine. Here's how to fix it:

1. Locate plumber.R on the Droplet
SSH into your droplet and locate the plumber.R file:

ssh root@<DROPLET_IP>
find / -name "plumber.R"
This will return the actual path where the file is located.

2. Update the Service File
Once you know the correct path, edit the service file:

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
Replace the placeholder /path/to/api/plumber.R with the actual path, for example:

ExecStart=/usr/bin/Rscript /home/username/api/plumber.R
3. Reload and Restart the Service
After updating the service file:

Reload the systemd daemon to apply changes:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
Restart the service:
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
Check the service status:
sudo systemctl status plumber-example.service
4. Test the API
Access your API through the IP address and port (e.g., http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000).

If the problem persists, double-check permissions and dependencies on the droplet. Let me know if you encounter further issues!

) what each parameter mean>
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here is an explanation of each parameter in the do_deploy_api function:

Parameters:
droplet

What it means: The DigitalOcean droplet object or ID where the API will be deployed.
Purpose: Specifies the server (droplet) where the API should be set up.
path

What it means: The name of the API deployment directory on the droplet.
Purpose: Defines the location on the droplet where the API files will be stored. For example, if path = "example", the API will be deployed in /example on the droplet.
localPath

What it means: The path to the local directory on your computer containing the Plumber API files.

Purpose: Specifies where the files (like plumber.R or server.R) are located on your local system so they can be transferred to the droplet.

Default: getwd(), which uses the current working directory.

port

What it means: The port number on the droplet that will be used to serve the API.
Purpose: Determines the port through which the API can be accessed (e.g., http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000 if port = 8000).
docs

What it means: A boolean value indicating whether the interactive Swagger documentation should be enabled for the API.
Purpose: If set to TRUE, users can see and interact with the API documentation directly in their browser (at http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000/__docs__/).
overwrite

What it means: A boolean value indicating whether to overwrite an existing deployment with the same name (path) on the droplet.
Purpose: Ensures that if an API is already deployed at the specified path, it will be replaced with the new version if this is set to TRUE.
Example in Practice:
do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "my-api",
  localPath = "/Users/username/my-plumber-api",
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
Deploys an API to the droplet specified by id.
The API is stored on the droplet at /my-api.
It uses files from the local directory /Users/username/my-plumber-api.
The API will be accessible at http://<DROPLET_IP>:8000.

The error indicates that the path parameter cannot include nested directories (e.g., Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API). It must be a single directory name without slashes.

Solution
Change the path parameter to a simpler, single-level directory name.

Updated Code
do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "infant-mortality-api",  # Use a simple, flat directory name
  localPath = getwd(),            # Keep the current working directory for local files
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
What Changed
path: Changed to infant-mortality-api (a flat directory name without /).
All other parameters remain the same.
If you need to distinguish between multiple APIs or datasets, you can name it something unique like infant-mortality-api-v1 or abortion-impact-api.







You said:
how do we know 	•	What it means: The name of the API deployment directory on the droplet.
	•	Purpose: Defines the location on the droplet where the API files will be stored. For example, if path = "example", the API will be deployed in /example on the droplet.
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To confirm and understand what the path parameter in do_deploy_api means, here's what happens and how you can verify it:

What the path parameter does
Name of Deployment Directory: The path parameter specifies the directory name on the droplet where your API will be stored and accessed.
If path = "example", the API files are stored in /example on the droplet.
Access Location: The URL to access the API will be tied to this directory. For instance, the API may be available at http://<droplet-IP>:8000/example.
How to Verify the Path
After Deployment:

Run the following commands to check where the files are deployed on the droplet:
ls /example  # Replace `/example` with your actual `path` value
You should see the files uploaded from your localPath.
Inspect the Droplet’s Directory:

SSH into the droplet:
ssh root@<droplet-IP>
Navigate to the /etc/systemd/system/ directory:
ls /etc/systemd/system/
Look for a service file corresponding to your API deployment (e.g., example.service).
Check the Service Config:

View the service configuration:
cat /etc/systemd/system/example.service
This will confirm where the ExecStart script points to, which should align with your path.
Example Deployment Output
If you deploy with:

do_deploy_api(
  droplet = id,
  path = "example",
  localPath = getwd(),
  port = 8000,
  docs = TRUE,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
The following happens:

The API is stored in /example on the droplet.
The API can be accessed at http://<droplet-IP>:8000/example.
This ensures the path parameter correctly defines the deployment directory and API endpoint.

 ssh_key_info()
Error in ssh_key_info() : could not find function "ssh_key_info"
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error indicates that the function ssh_key_info() is not available. This is likely because the analogsea package, which provides the function, is either not installed correctly or not loaded into your R environment.

Steps to Resolve:
1. Check and Install the analogsea Package
Ensure that the analogsea package is installed. Use the following commands:

if (!requireNamespace("analogsea", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("analogsea")
}
If you continue to face installation issues, try installing it directly from GitHub:

remotes::install_github("sckott/analogsea")
2. Load the analogsea Package
After installation, load the package into your R session:

library(analogsea)
3. Generate SSH Key
If you don't have an SSH key, you can generate one manually:

key_create(name = "my-key", public_key = readLines("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"))
Make sure the path ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub exists and points to your public key file. If it does not, you can generate an SSH key on your machine:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
4. List Existing Keys
Once the analogsea package is installed and loaded, use ssh_key_info() to list available SSH keys:

ssh_key_info()
Common Issues and Fixes:
"Function Not Found": Ensure analogsea is properly installed and loaded.
"Public Key Not Found": Verify that ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub exists. If not, generate an SSH key as described above.
Permissions Error: Ensure you have proper access rights to the SSH key files and your R environment.

setwd(Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The setwd() function in R is used to set the working directory. However, in your example, the path includes spaces, and it is not properly enclosed in quotes. R requires paths with spaces to be quoted correctly, either with single or double quotes.

Here’s the correct way to use setwd() for your directory:

setwd("Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API")
Notes:
Ensure the path is relative to your current working directory or provide the absolute path.

Relative path: "Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API"
Absolute path: "/full/path/to/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API"
Check if the directory exists by running:

dir.exists("Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API")
This will return TRUE if the directory exists or FALSE otherwise.

To verify the current working directory after setting it:

getwd()
Let me know if you encounter any issues!







You said:
setwd("Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API")
Error in setwd("Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API") : 
  cannot change working directory
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error cannot change working directory indicates that the directory you specified does not exist or the path is incorrect. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. Verify the Path
Ensure that the directory Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API exists in your current working directory.
Check the full path of the directory. If the directory is nested deeper or located elsewhere, you may need to specify the absolute path.
Example of an absolute path:

setwd("/Users/username/Documents/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API")
2. Check the Current Working Directory
Run the following command to determine where R is currently pointing:

getwd()
If the target directory is not relative to the current working directory, use an absolute path.

3. List Files in the Current Directory
Verify whether the target folder exists by listing the contents of your current working directory:

list.files()
If the directory Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion is not listed, you might need to check its location.

4. Fix Directory Path
Ensure you are using the correct path format. Replace spaces in the path with proper quoting:

setwd("path/to/'Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API'")
Alternatively, escape spaces with \\:

setwd("path/to/Relationship\\ between\\ infant\\ mortality\\ rate\\ and\\ prohibited\\ abortion/API")
5. Test the Path
Use file.exists() to test whether the directory exists:

file.exists("path/to/Relationship between infant mortality rate and prohibited abortion/API")
6. Locate the Directory
If you’re unsure about the directory’s location, use the file dialog to select it manually:

setwd(choose.dir())
7. Check Permissions
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access the directory.

If you still encounter issues, share the output of getwd() and list.files(), and I’ll help you debug further.

4. Verify File Permissions
Ensure that the plumber.R script and its directory have the correct permissions:

ls -l /path/to/your/api/plumber.R
The file should be readable by the systemd service. If not, set the correct permissions:

sudo chmod +rx /path/to/your/api/plumber.R
5. Validate R and Plumber Installation
Ensure that R and the required R packages (plumber, etc.) are installed on the server and accessible in the environment running the service:

Rscript -e 'library(plumber); print("Plumber is installed and working!")'
If any dependencies are missing, install them:

sudo Rscript -e 'install.packages(c("plumber", "your_other_packages"))'
6. Reload and Restart the Service
After fixing any issues, reload the systemd daemon and restart the service:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
7. Re-Test the API
Once the service is active, test the API by accessing it in your browser or using curl:

curl http://your-droplet-ip:8000
8. Optional: Debugging via Rscript
Run the plumber.R script manually to ensure it works outside of systemd:

Rscript /path/to/your/api/plumber.R
If this command fails, debug the script by checking for missing dependencies, syntax errors, or runtime issues.

Common Fixes Checklist
Service File Path: Correct ExecStart in the service file.
Dependencies: Ensure plumber and other required R packages are installed.
Permissions: Verify permissions for the service file and the plumber.R script.

The error indicates that your server password has expired, and because the system is trying to perform operations requiring authentication (like stopping services, removing configurations, etc.), it's failing.

Steps to Fix the Issue:
1. Access Your Droplet/Server
You need to access the server directly via SSH to reset the expired password.

Run the following command from your local machine:

ssh root@your-droplet-ip
If prompted, enter the current expired password, and you'll likely be asked to set a new password.

2. Change the Expired Password
Once connected to the droplet, reset your password when prompted. If you’re not prompted, you can manually change it:

passwd
Follow the instructions to set a new password.

3. Retry the Commands
After resetting the password, retry stopping and reconfiguring the Plumber service:

sudo systemctl stop plumber-example
sudo systemctl disable plumber-example
sudo rm /etc/systemd/system/plumber-example.service
sudo rm -rf /var/plumber/example
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
4. Verify Folder Existence
Check if the /var/plumber/example directory exists:

if [ -d /var/plumber/example ]; then echo 'TRUE'; else echo 'FALSE'; fi
If it exists, delete it manually:

sudo rm -rf /var/plumber/example
Additional Notes:
Automate Password Updates: To avoid password expiration, set your password policy to not expire for the root user:
sudo chage -I -1 -m 0 -M 99999 -E -1 root
Key-Based Authentication: Instead of relying on passwords, set up SSH keys to authenticate without needing a password. This will bypass such issues in the future. Follow instructions here.

The error indicates that your-droplet-ip was used literally, but it should be replaced with the actual IP address of your droplet.

How to Fix:
Find Your Droplet's IP Address

Log in to your cloud provider's dashboard (e.g., DigitalOcean).
Navigate to your droplet or virtual server.
Find and note down its public IPv4 address.
Connect Using the Correct IP Address Replace your-droplet-ip with the actual IP address. For example, if your droplet's IP is 123.45.67.89, run:

ssh root@123.45.67.89
Troubleshooting Connection Issues If you still can't connect:

Check if the Droplet is Running: Ensure your droplet is active and has no issues on the provider dashboard.
Verify Network Settings: Make sure your firewall or security group allows SSH connections (port 22).
Use ping to Test Connectivity:
ping 123.45.67.89
If there's no response, your server might be down or inaccessible.
Use a Droplet Management Tool If you're on DigitalOcean and have analogsea installed, list and access your droplets programmatically:

library(analogsea)
droplets()  # List droplets and their IPs
droplet <- droplet_find("your-droplet-name")  # Replace with droplet name
ssh(droplet)

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you’re stuck at the Current password: prompt and unable to type anything, don’t worry—it’s expected behavior for Linux systems. Here's what's happening and how to resolve it:

Why Can't You See Typing?
When entering a password in a terminal, the input is hidden (not echoed) for security reasons. This means you can type, but it won't show any characters (not even asterisks *).

Steps to Proceed:
Type Your Current Password

Carefully type your current password. Remember that nothing will appear on the screen as you type.
Press Enter

After typing the password, press Enter.
Follow the Prompts

If your current password is correct, the system will prompt you to enter a new password.
Type your new password when asked, and press Enter.
Re-enter the new password to confirm, and press Enter.
If You Forgot Your Current Password:
If you don't know the current root password, you will need to reset it:

Access Recovery Mode (if using a cloud provider like DigitalOcean, AWS, or others):
Log in to your provider's dashboard.
Use their recovery console or rescue mode to reset the password.
Boot into Single-User Mode (if it's a physical server):
Reboot the server.
Interrupt the boot process and select single-user mode.
Use the following command to reset the root password:
passwd root

library(plumber)
pr <- plumb("path/to/plumber.R")  # Adjust the path to your script
pr$run(port = 8000)
This command starts the Plumber API on port 8000.
Verify Localhost Port

Ensure that port 8000 is not in use by another service.
Run the following command in the terminal to check:
lsof -i :8000
If another process is using port 8000, stop it or use a different port.
Firewall or Network Issues

If you're running this on a remote server, ensure the server's firewall allows traffic on port 8000.
Open the port in your firewall:
sudo ufw allow 8000
Accessing the API

If you're on a remote server and trying to access the API via http://localhost:8000, replace localhost with the server's IP address or domain name:
curl http://your-server-ip:8000
Check the Logs

If the Plumber service was deployed using systemctl, check its logs to understand why it's failing:
sudo systemctl status plumber-example.service
sudo journalctl -u plumber-example.service
Restart the Service

If the service is configured but isn't running, restart it:
sudo systemctl restart plumber-example.service
Test Using Browser or Postman

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. If the API server is running, you should see the API documentation or an endpoint response.
Common Causes
Server Not Started: The Plumber API wasn't started on port 8000.
Port Conflict: Another application is using port 8000.
Firewall Rules: The port is blocked by a firewall.
Incorrect Address: Trying to access localhost on a remote server without SSH port forwarding or replacing it with the server's IP.

The command you provided is used to copy your local SSH public key to a remote server's authorized_keys file. This allows you to log in to the remote server using SSH without being prompted for a password.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

Command Breakdown
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh username@203.0.113.0 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:

Reads your local public SSH key from ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
| (pipe):

Sends the output of the cat command (your public key) as input to the following ssh command.
ssh username@203.0.113.0:

Logs into the remote server (203.0.113.0) as username.
Remote Command:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
mkdir -p ~/.ssh: Ensures the .ssh directory exists on the remote server. The -p flag prevents errors if the directory already exists.
cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys: Appends your public key to the authorized_keys file in the remote .ssh directory.
Steps to Execute
Ensure You Have an SSH Public Key:

Check if the public key exists on your local machine:
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If it doesn't exist, generate a key pair:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Run the Command:

Replace username with your username on the remote server.
Replace 203.0.113.0 with the IP address or domain of the remote server.
Verify the Connection:

After running the command, verify that you can log in without a password:
ssh username@203.0.113.0
Common Issues and Solutions
Permission Denied Error:

Ensure you have permission to access the remote server.
If you're prompted for a password, ensure the username and IP are correct.
Remote .ssh Directory Permissions:

Ensure the .ssh directory and authorized_keys file on the remote server have the correct permissions:

shenxiner1@143.110.228.80: Permission denied (publickey).
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The error Permission denied (publickey) indicates that the SSH connection to the server is failing because the server does not recognize your public key. Here’s how you can troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

Steps to Resolve
1. Verify the Public Key Exists Locally
Check if your SSH key pair exists:
ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If the file does not exist, generate a new SSH key pair:
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and provide a passphrase (optional).
2. Manually Copy the Public Key
Since ssh is currently restricted, you can manually copy your public key:
Display the public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Copy the key starting with ssh-rsa to the clipboard.
Log in to the remote server using a password or other method (if possible).
Add the key to the remote server:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo "PASTE_YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. Ensure SSH Key Authentication is Enabled on the Server
SSH might not be configured to accept keys. Log in via a password (if enabled) and check /etc/ssh/sshd_config on the server:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ensure the following lines are present and uncommented:

PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
Restart the SSH service after making changes:

sudo systemctl restart ssh
4. Use the Correct User
Ensure you’re using the correct username (shenxiner1) for the server.

Test the connection explicitly using the key:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa shenxiner1@143.110.228.80
5. Check Server Permissions
Ensure that the remote ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file have the correct permissions:
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
6. Verify the SSH Key on the Server
Check if the public key is correctly added to the server:
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Ensure the public key matches the one on your local machine (~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub).
7. Debugging the Connection
Use the -v (verbose) flag to debug the SSH connection:
ssh -v shenxiner1@143.110.228.80
This will provide detailed information about what’s causing the failure.
Additional Notes
If you are still unable to connect, verify:

Your IP address is whitelisted (if using a firewall or security group).
The SSH server is running on the expected port (default: 22).
Let me know if you encounter specific issues while following these steps!







You said:
Permission denied (publickey).
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The Permission denied (publickey) error indicates that the server is not allowing you to authenticate using your public key. Here’s how to resolve it step by step:

1. Confirm Your Public Key Exists Locally
Run the following command to check if your SSH public key exists:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Log in to the Server with a Password (if possible):

ssh username@143.110.228.80
Manually Add the Key:

mkdir -p ~/.ssh
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Logout and Test the Connection:

ssh username@143.110.228.80
Option B: Use ssh-copy-id (Recommended if Password Access is Enabled)
Copy the Key Automatically:

ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub username@143.110.228.80
Test the Connection:

ssh username@143.110.228.80
3. Check SSH Configuration on the Server
If the public key is not being accepted, the server’s SSH configuration might need adjustments.

Log in via a password (if possible) and edit the SSH configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Ensure the following lines are present and uncommented:

PubkeyAuthentication yes
AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys
Restart the SSH service:

sudo systemctl restart ssh
4. Verify Permissions on the Server
Ensure that the ~/.ssh directory and authorized_keys file on the server have the correct permissions:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
5. Debug the SSH Connection

ssh -v username@143.110.228.80
Look for lines indicating why the authentication is failing.
Common issues include:
The key is not found in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
The key permissions are too open (they must be 600 for authorized_keys).
6. Verify Your SSH Agent
If you are using an SSH agent, ensure the key is loaded:

ssh-add -l
If no key is listed, add it:
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
7. Confirm the Server IP Address and User
Ensure that:

You are connecting to the correct server IP address.
You are using the correct username.
For example:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@143.110.228.80

Go to the public key field of your service (e.g., DigitalOcean, GitHub, or your server settings) and paste the copied key directly into the appropriate location.

Save the configuration.

Example for DigitalOcean:
Navigate to Security -> SSH Keys in your DigitalOcean account.
Click Add SSH Key.
Paste the copied key into the field provided.
Assign a name for the key (e.g., "MacBook-Air").
Save the key.
Example for Manual Server Setup:
If you're manually adding the key to a server, log in via a password (if possible) and append the key to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file:

echo "PASTED_PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENT" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Make sure you don't omit any part of the key, as all components (the ssh-rsa prefix, the base64 key, and the username/hostname) are necessary for successful authentication.

There seem to be an issue with Digital Ocean web portal when adding 2nd SSH key. The portal show there are 2 SSH keys (Settings\Security\SSH keys).

However, checking authorized_keys file (nano .ssh/authorized_keys), only the 1st SSH key was there and the 2nd SSH key was not found.

Work a round fix was to login the Ubuntu server/droplet (using the working local Ubuntu machine for my case), and manually add 2nd SSH key (for MacOS machine) to authorized_keys file.

Server/Droplet Ubuntu: nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

MacOS local machine: cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub ( I used ed25519 type in this instance, change to whatever yours pub key is).

Paste the SSH pub key to authorized_key file.

Reload ssh on Ubuntu server/droplet: systemctl reload ssh

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To resolve the issue with adding a second SSH key to the authorized_keys file on your DigitalOcean droplet, you can follow these steps to manually add the key and reload the SSH service:

Step 1: Access the Droplet
Login to the droplet using the working SSH key (your first key):
ssh username@your-droplet-ip
Step 2: Retrieve the Second SSH Key from the MacOS Machine
On your MacOS machine, retrieve the second SSH public key:

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
If your public key file is named differently (e.g., id_rsa.pub), replace id_ed25519.pub with the appropriate filename.
Copy the full output of the above command to your clipboard.

Step 3: Add the Second Key to the Droplet
Once logged into the droplet, edit the authorized_keys file:

nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Paste the SSH public key (from Step 2) on a new line at the end of the file.

Save the changes:

Press Ctrl + O to save the file.
Press Enter to confirm.
Press Ctrl + X to exit the editor.
Step 4: Reload the SSH Service
After adding the new key, reload the SSH service to ensure the changes take effect:
sudo systemctl reload ssh
Step 5: Test the Second Key
Try logging in to the droplet using the second key from the MacOS machine:
ssh username@your-droplet-ip
Additional Notes:
If you encounter issues with permissions, ensure the ~/.ssh folder and authorized_keys file have the correct permissions:

chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
If you're using a different SSH key pair (not id_ed25519), make sure to specify the private key when connecting:

ssh -i ~/.ssh/your_private_key username@your-droplet-ip
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully add the second SSH key and log in from both machines.

Password: what is password here
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you are being prompted for a password, it is likely referring to one of the following:

Root User Password or Server User Password

This is the password for the user account you are logging in with, such as root or shenxiner1.
This password is typically set when you first create your droplet on DigitalOcean. If you don’t remember setting it, check your email inbox for a message from DigitalOcean containing the initial password for your droplet.
Sudo Privilege Password

If you're running a command with sudo, it's asking for the password of the user you're logged in as, which must have sudo privileges. For example, if you're logged in as shenxiner1, the password for shenxiner1 is required.
SSH Key Passphrase (Optional)

If your SSH private key (id_rsa or similar) is encrypted with a passphrase, you’ll need to provide that passphrase when connecting to the server.
If You Don't Know the Password
Reset the Droplet Password

Go to your DigitalOcean control panel and select the droplet.
Navigate to the "Access" section, then click Reset Root Password.
DigitalOcean will send you an email with a new root password. Use this to log in.
Check if SSH Key Authentication is Set Up

If you have added your SSH key to the server, you may not need a password. Ensure you're connecting via SSH:
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa shenxiner1@<your-droplet-ip>
Re-add Your SSH Key

If your SSH key was not set up properly, you might need to manually add it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the droplet. Follow this guide to add your public key:
echo "your-public-key-content" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

Step 2: Test SSH Access
From your local machine, test the connection:

ssh username@server_ip
Replace username with your server username (e.g., root or your custom username).
Replace server_ip with your server's IP address.
Step 3: Ensure SSH Key is Registered in Your Local SSH Agent
Add your SSH private key to the agent:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
If your key has a passphrase, you'll need to enter it.
List keys to confirm the addition:

ssh-add -l
Step 4: Verify the SSH Configuration
Edit your SSH configuration file on the local machine:

nano ~/.ssh/config
Add the following (if not already present):

Host my-server
    HostName server_ip
    User username
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Replace my-server with a custom name for the server.
Replace server_ip with your server's IP address.
Replace username with your server username.
Save and exit nano (Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X).

Test the connection using the alias:

ssh my-server
Step 5: Link DigitalOcean Account with SSH
If you're using DigitalOcean, verify the SSH keys in the dashboard:

Go to the DigitalOcean Control Panel > Settings > Security > SSH Keys.
Ensure your local machine's public key is added to the list.
If not:

Add your key:
Title: Give it a name like "My MacBook Key".
Paste the public key from cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
Save and retry your connection.
Step 6: Retry Your Deployment or Actions
Now, you should be able to:

SSH into the server.
Perform deployments using tools like analogsea or Plumber API scripts.
If you encounter further issues, provide the exact error, and we can debug further!

ChatGPT
To link your DigitalOcean account again, you’ll need to authenticate using an API token. Follow these steps:

Step 1: Generate a New API Token
Log in to the DigitalOcean Control Panel: Go to DigitalOcean.

Navigate to API Settings:

Go to API in the left-hand menu.
Under Tokens/Keys, click Generate New Token.
Generate a Token:

Name the token something like My API Token.
Set the Permissions to "Read and Write".
Click Generate Token.
Save the Token:

Copy the token as it will only be shown once.
Step 2: Link the API Token Locally
Store the Token Locally: Use the analogsea package to set up your DigitalOcean API access:

library(analogsea)

# Add your API token
options(digitalocean.token = "your_api_token")
Save the Token for Future Use: If you want to avoid setting the token each time, you can save it to your R environment:

Open the .Renviron file:
usethis::edit_r_environ()
Add the following line:
DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_api_token
Save and restart your R session for the changes to take effect.
Step 3: Verify the Connection
List Existing Droplets: Run this command to check your existing droplets:

library(analogsea)

droplets()
If your token is valid and linked correctly, you should see a list of your droplets.

Create a Droplet (If Needed): If you want to create a new droplet:

droplet_create(name = "my-droplet")
Step 4: Retry Deployment
If you're using plumberDeploy, you can now redeploy your API using the linked account:

library(plumberDeploy)

do_provision()  # Provision a droplet
do_deploy_api(droplet = droplet, path = "api", localPath = getwd(), port = 8000)
Step 5: Test Your Deployment
After deployment, use your browser to check the deployed API:

http://your-droplet-ip:8000
If you still encounter issues, ensure:

The token has "Read and Write" permissions.
Your ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on the droplet contains your public SSH key.
Run droplets() to confirm your DigitalOcean API access.

clean the account information in r
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To clean up or remove the DigitalOcean account information in R, you need to delete the associated API token and any stored credentials. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Remove API Token from the Environment
If you stored your DigitalOcean API token in the R environment using options(), you can clear it:

# Remove the API token from the current session
options(digitalocean.token = NULL)
2. Remove Token from .Renviron File
If you saved the token in the .Renviron file for persistence, you need to edit the file and delete the token entry:

Open .Renviron:
usethis::edit_r_environ()
Locate the Line: Find the line that looks like:
DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_api_token
Remove or Comment Out: Either delete the line or comment it out by adding a # at the beginning:
# DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN=your_api_token
Save the File: Save the file and restart your R session for the changes to take effect.
3. Remove SSH Key Information
If you've added SSH key information in your project or session, remove it:

Delete Stored Key in R Session:

ssh_keys <- analogsea::keys()
analogsea::key_delete(ssh_keys$id)  # Replace `ssh_keys$id` with the actual key ID
Manually Remove Keys on the Droplet (Optional): SSH into your droplet and clean up ~/.ssh/authorized_keys if necessary:

nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Remove the line(s) with the public key you want to delete
4. Clear Cached Credentials (If Any)
If you used other tools that cached your DigitalOcean credentials, clear them:

In R:

unlink("~/.analogsea", recursive = TRUE)
On Your System: Look for any files or configurations related to DigitalOcean (e.g., ~/.ssh or ~/.digitalocean) and delete them if appropriate.

5. Verify Clean-Up
Check if Token is Gone:

options("digitalocean.token")
This should return NULL if the token has been removed.

Check SSH Keys on Droplet: Run the following in R to verify no linked keys exist:

analogsea::keys()
By following these steps, you ensure that any stored DigitalOcean credentials or SSH keys are removed from your R environment and system.

how to delete key using key_delete
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To delete an SSH key in DigitalOcean using the key_delete function from the analogsea package in R, follow these steps:

Steps to Delete an SSH Key
List All Available Keys: Use the keys() function to fetch the list of SSH keys currently associated with your DigitalOcean account:

library(analogsea)

# List all SSH keys
ssh_keys <- keys()
print(ssh_keys)
This will display information about all SSH keys, including their id and name.

Identify the Key to Delete: From the output of keys(), note the id or name of the SSH key you want to delete.
Delete the Key: Use the key_delete() function to remove the SSH key. Replace key_id_or_name with the id or name of the SSH key you want to delete:

# Replace 'key_id_or_name' with the ID or name of the key to delete
key_delete(key_id_or_name)
For example:

key_delete(1234567)  # If you use the key ID
key_delete("my-ssh-key")  # If you use the key name
Verify Deletion: After deleting the key, run keys() again to ensure the key is no longer in the list:
# Verify the key has been deleted
keys()
Important Notes:
If you are unsure which key corresponds to your target, use the output of keys() to identify it clearly.
You can only delete keys associated with your DigitalOcean account.
By following these steps, you can clean up unwanted SSH keys from your DigitalOcean account programmatically using R.

 I want to relink account in analogsea
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To relink your DigitalOcean account in the analogsea R package, follow these steps:

Steps to Relink DigitalOcean Account
Clear Existing Authentication Information (Optional): If you have previously linked your account and want to start fresh:
library(analogsea)

# Clear cached DigitalOcean token
analogsea::droplet_cleanup()
Obtain a New Personal Access Token (PAT):
Go to DigitalOcean API Tokens.
Create a new token if you don’t already have one.
Copy the token to use it in the next step.
Set the New Token in R: Use the analogsea::droplet_create() function to authenticate with your new token. You can pass the token directly, or save it in the environment for reuse.

Option 1: Pass the Token Directly
library(analogsea)

# Replace "your_personal_access_token" with the token from DigitalOcean
analogsea::account(token = "your_personal_access_token")
Option 2: Save the Token to Your Environment
Add the following to your .Renviron file:

DO_PAT=your_personal_access_token
Then restart your R session. The analogsea package will automatically use this token.

You can edit the .Renviron file directly in R:

usethis::edit_r_environ()
Verify the Account Connection: After setting the token, verify the connection with DigitalOcean:

library(analogsea)

# Verify the account
analogsea::account()
This should return your account details, confirming the relink is successful.

Troubleshooting:
Ensure your token has the necessary permissions (e.g., read/write for droplets, SSH keys, etc.).
If you encounter an error with a cached token, clear it with:
analogsea::key_cache_clear()
By following these steps, you can successfully relink your DigitalOcean account to the analogsea package in R.

droplet_ssh(
+     droplet,

+ )
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
It seems you're trying to use the droplet_ssh() function in the analogsea package to access a DigitalOcean droplet. However, there are a few issues with your code snippet:

Issues in Your Code:
Invalid Argument: ssh_passwd
The analogsea::droplet_ssh() function does not have a ssh_passwd argument. SSH authentication typically uses an SSH key, not a password.

Incorrect keyfile Argument
The keyfile argument should point to the path of your private SSH key (e.g., ~/.ssh/id_rsa).

Droplet Object Missing
You must provide a valid droplet object created with analogsea::droplet_create() or retrieved with analogsea::droplets().

Correct Usage of droplet_ssh():
Here’s how to correctly use the function:

Pre-Requisites:
Ensure you have added your SSH public key to the droplet.
Locate your private key file (usually in ~/.ssh/id_rsa).
Code Example:
library(analogsea)

# Retrieve the droplet
droplet <- droplet_find(name = "your-droplet-name")

# Connect to the droplet via SSH
droplet_ssh(
  droplet = droplet,
  user = "root",                 # Default user for DigitalOcean droplets
  keyfile = "~/.ssh/id_rsa",     # Path to your private SSH key
  verbose = TRUE                 # Optional: Set TRUE to see the connection details
)
Notes:
Password-Based SSH (Not Recommended):
If you absolutely need to use a password instead of an SSH key, you’ll need to connect manually via a terminal (outside of R):

ssh root@<droplet-ip>
Then enter your password when prompted.

Verbose Output:
Set verbose = TRUE for detailed SSH connection logs.

Managing Droplet Keys:
Ensure the SSH public key you use locally is added to your DigitalOcean droplet.

Troubleshooting SSH Issues:

If you receive a "Permission denied" error, ensure your SSH key is correctly configured in the authorized_keys file on the droplet.
You can inspect or update the file using:
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
This approach should resolve your issue and allow you to SSH into your droplet programmatically using analogsea.

Here’s an updated Training Data and Training Procedure section based on your provided code:

Training Data
The training data is sourced from the Linked Birth/Infant Death Records (2017-2022) dataset, which includes data on infant mortality rates across U.S. states. The dataset contains variables such as maternal age, maternal race, state of residence, year and month of infant death, and death rates per 1,000 live births.

Preprocessed Data
The raw data was cleaned and processed as follows:

Renaming Columns: All column names were converted to lowercase and standardized for consistency.
Variable Selection: Only relevant columns, such as state, age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, year_of_death, month, and death_rate, were retained.
Handling Missing Data: Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data completeness.
Derived Variables:
after_injunction: A binary indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no) denoting whether the infant death occurred after June 2022.
abortion_illegal: A binary indicator (1 = yes, 0 = no) denoting whether abortion was illegal in the mother’s state of residence.
reliable: A categorical variable specifying if the death rate is "Reliable" or "Unreliable" based on NCHS standards.
Data Type Conversion: Columns such as death_rate were cleaned and converted to numeric values for analysis.
Date Variable: A date column was created by combining the year_of_death and month_code.
The cleaned dataset is saved in both CSV and Parquet formats for further analysis:

CSV File: data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv
Parquet File: data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.parquet
Training Procedure
The training data preparation process involved the following steps:

Preprocessing
Input Data: The raw dataset was read from the file Linked_Birth_Infant_Death_Records_2017-2022_Expanded.txt using a tab-delimited format, allowing for irregular line structures.
Data Cleaning: Using the janitor and tidyverse libraries, the dataset was cleaned to:
Remove missing values (tidyr::drop_na()).
Standardize column names (janitor::clean_names()).
Feature Engineering: Key features were engineered:
abortion_illegal: Created based on a list of states where abortion was illegal after June 2022.
after_injunction: Indicates the time period relative to June 2022.
date: Consolidates the year and month into a single Date object.
Data Transformation: Columns such as death_rate were converted to numeric format, with reliability information separated into a dedicated column (reliable).
Output: The processed dataset was saved in both CSV and Parquet formats for compatibility with different analysis tools.
Training Data Accessibility
The cleaned dataset can be accessed and downloaded from the following:

CSV File - Analysis Data
Parquet File - Analysis Data
By preparing the data in this manner, the training process ensures a clean, reliable, and interpretable dataset ready for downstream tasks such as modeling and analysis.

This subset includes demographic, temporal, and geographic factors relevant to evaluating the causal impact of abortion bans. Key attributes include:

States with and without abortion bans post-June 2022.
Temporal data: Infant deaths categorized before and after the abortion injunctions.
Demographic data: Maternal age and race.
Factors
Evaluation of the model's performance was disaggregated across the following factors:

Policy Factors:

States categorized based on abortion legality (abortion_illegal).
Timing relative to the abortion injunction (after_injunction).
Demographic Factors:

Maternal race (mothers_single_race).
Maternal age group (age_of_mother).
Temporal Factors:

Year and month of death (year_of_death, date).
Metrics
The evaluation metrics used to assess the models include:

Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):

Measures the average prediction error.
Lower RMSE indicates better model fit.
R-squared ($R^2$):

Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Higher $R^2$ values represent a better fit.
Posterior Predictive Checks:

Examines the alignment of predicted and observed values to assess model calibration.
Significance of Coefficients:

Evaluates the statistical significance of key predictors, including interaction terms like after_injunction * abortion_illegal.
Results
Model 1: Focuses on policy factors (after_injunction and abortion_illegal) and their interaction.

RMSE: 0.25 deaths per 1,000 live births.
$R^2$: 0.67.
The interaction term (after_injunction * abortion_illegal) was statistically significant, indicating an increase in infant mortality rates in states with abortion bans after June 2022.
Model 2: Incorporates additional demographic factors (age_of_mother, mothers_single_race).

RMSE: 0.22 deaths per 1,000 live births.
$R^2$: 0.74.
Older maternal age groups were associated with lower infant mortality rates, while Black mothers experienced disproportionately higher rates.
Summary
The models effectively captured the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates, with significant differences observed in states with restrictive abortion policies. Demographic disparities, such as race and maternal age, further influenced mortality rates, highlighting the compounded effects of policy and social factors.

Model Examination [optional]
The models underwent posterior predictive checks and comparison between prior and posterior distributions:

Posterior Predictive Checks:
Demonstrated good alignment between predicted and observed infant mortality rates, validating model fit.
Prior vs. Posterior Distributions:
Confirmed that the data significantly informed posterior estimates, particularly for key predictors like the interaction term.

Your results likely include a code chunk because they were derived from statistical analysis or computational models, and the inclusion of code demonstrates transparency and reproducibility. In data analysis, it's common to provide the code used to produce results alongside the summary or interpretation of those results. Here's how you might reformat and integrate this into your results section:

Results
Model 1
Focus: Evaluates the effects of policy factors (after_injunction and abortion_illegal) and their interaction on infant mortality rates.
Performance Metrics:
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 4.21 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$): 0.256.
Key Findings:
The interaction term (after_injunction * abortion_illegal) was statistically significant, suggesting an increase in infant mortality rates in states enforcing abortion bans after June 2022.
Model 2
Focus: Expands Model 1 by incorporating additional demographic factors, including age_of_mother and mothers_single_race.
Performance Metrics:
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 2.36 deaths per 1,000 live births.
Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$): 0.793.
Key Findings:
Older maternal age groups were associated with lower infant mortality rates.
Black mothers experienced disproportionately higher rates of infant mortality.
By separating the narrative summary from the computational details (code), the results are easier to understand while still being scientifically rigorous. If you need to include code chunks in an appendix or as supplementary material, you can reference them explicitly. For example:

For detailed analysis and the exact code used in the computations, see Appendix A or the supplementary material.

To include this equation in your Markdown file, you can use the following format:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Second Model}:\mu_i &= \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i + \beta_2\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i \\
&+ \beta_3\cdot\text{After Injunction}_i\cdot\text{Abortion Illegal}_i \\

$$
Explanation of Changes:
Line breaks: In LaTeX, adding \\ creates line breaks within the equation.
Indentation for readability: Splitting the equation into multiple lines makes it easier to read and avoids clutter in the Markdown file.
When rendered in Markdown with LaTeX support, this will correctly display the equation on multiple lines.

how to construct toc in md file?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To construct a Table of Contents (TOC) in a Markdown file, you can follow these steps:

1. Use Heading Levels
Markdown TOC is automatically generated based on heading levels (#, ##, ###, etc.). Ensure you use proper heading levels in your file.

# Main Title
## Section 1
### Subsection 1.1
## Section 2
### Subsection 2.1
2. Add a TOC Placeholder (Optional)
If you are using a Markdown renderer (e.g., GitHub, VS Code, or a static site generator like Jekyll), you can include a placeholder for the TOC:

# Table of Contents
- [Main Title](#main-title)
  - [Section 1](#section-1)
    - [Subsection 1.1](#subsection-11)
  - [Section 2](#section-2)
    - [Subsection 2.1](#subsection-21)
The links in the TOC use the following format:

Replace spaces in the heading with hyphens (-).
Convert the text to lowercase.
Strip out special characters.
For example:

# Section 1 becomes [Section 1](#section-1)
## Subsection 1.1 becomes [Subsection 1.1](#subsection-11)
3. Automate TOC Creation
If your Markdown editor supports TOC generation, it can create the links automatically. For example:

In VS Code, use the Markdown All in One extension and type <!-- TOC --> to auto-generate a TOC.
Example Markdown with TOC
# Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [Methodology](#methodology)
  - [Data Collection](#data-collection)
  - [Model Design](#model-design)
- [Results](#results)
  - [Model 1](#model-1)

how to link section and words in readme.md file
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To link sections and specific words in a README.md file (or any Markdown file), you can use anchors and hyperlinks. Here’s how to do it:

1. Linking Sections Within the File
Use the section headers as anchors. In Markdown, headers automatically generate unique anchors based on their text.

Steps:
Write your section headers with #, ##, ###, etc.
Create a link by using the format [Link Text](#section-name).
Rules for Anchors:
Convert the header text to lowercase.
Replace spaces with hyphens (-).
Remove special characters (e.g., commas, colons).
Example:
# Introduction
Welcome to the introduction.

## Methodology
Details about the methodology.

## Results
Findings from the analysis.

[Go to Methodology](#methodology)  
[Go to Results](#results)
Output:

[Go to Methodology](#methodology) links to the "Methodology" section.
[Go to Results](#results) links to the "Results" section.
2. Linking Words to Other Sections
To link specific words to sections in the same file, use the same anchor syntax.

Example:
See the [Introduction](#introduction) for an overview.
This will create a link for the word "Introduction" that jumps to the section titled "Introduction."

3. Linking to External URLs
To link words to external URLs, simply provide the URL in the link.

Example:
You can view the dataset on [CDC Wonder](https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D159).
4. Combining Internal and External Links
You can mix internal links and external links in your README.md.

Example:
# Table of Contents

Impact of Abortion Bans on Infant Mortality Rates in the United States (2021–2022)
Overview
This repository contains the analysis and methodology used to examine the impact of abortion bans following the 2022 Dobbs decision on infant mortality rates in the United States. The primary objective is to quantify the changes in infant mortality rates in states where abortion became illegal compared to states where it remained legal. The analysis employs Bayesian Difference-in-Differences (DID) models, incorporating both policy factors and demographic variables, to understand these changes in-depth.

The project draws on data from the CDC WONDER database (2021–2022) and explores the implications of policy changes on public health. It also discusses the data preparation process, statistical modeling, and the limitations of using observational data for causal inference. This repository provides all the necessary data, R scripts, and documentation for readers to reproduce and understand the study's findings on the intersection of reproductive policy and infant health outcomes.

 Dobbs Decision detailed for what decision
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The Dobbs Decision refers to the landmark ruling by the United States Supreme Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization on June 24, 2022. This decision overturned the precedent set by Roe v. Wade (1973) and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), effectively ending the constitutional protection for the right to abortion in the United States.

Key Details of the Decision:
Case Background:

The case originated from a Mississippi law, known as the Gestational Age Act, which banned most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, significantly earlier than the viability standard established by Roe v. Wade.
The Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only abortion clinic in Mississippi, challenged the law, arguing that it violated the constitutional right to abortion as established under Roe v. Wade.
Supreme Court Ruling:

In a 6-3 majority decision, the Court upheld the Mississippi law.
In a 5-4 decision, the Court explicitly overturned Roe v. Wade, declaring that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion and that the issue should be decided by individual states.
Impact of the Ruling:

The Dobbs decision returned the authority to regulate abortion to the states, leading to a patchwork of laws across the country.
Many states, particularly in the South and Midwest, enacted trigger laws or implemented bans and restrictions on abortion immediately after the ruling.
Other states, predominantly in the Northeast and on the West Coast, maintained or expanded access to abortion.
Significance:

The Dobbs decision marked one of the most consequential shifts in U.S. reproductive policy in decades.
It raised critical debates about women's rights, bodily autonomy, healthcare access, and public health implications, particularly for marginalized communities.
In the context of this study, the Dobbs decision's effects are analyzed through its role in shaping state-level abortion laws, which subsequently impacted public health outcomes, such as infant mortality rates.

how to use underscore in r
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In R, underscores (_) are commonly used in variable names, function names, and column names to improve readability. However, the underscore also has specific uses depending on the context. Below are some examples of how to use underscores in R:

1. In Variable Names
Use underscores to separate words for better readability.
# Defining a variable with underscores
infant_mortality_rate <- 5.2
print(infant_mortality_rate)
2. In Column Names
When working with data frames, column names can include underscores.
# Creating a data frame with column names that use underscores
data <- data.frame(
  state_name = c("California", "Texas"),
  infant_mortality_rate = c(4.5, 6.1)
)
print(data)
3. With dplyr and tidyr Functions
Use underscores in function names to clearly express operations.
# Using dplyr and underscores in function names
library(dplyr)

cleaned_data <- data %>%
  rename(state = state_name) %>%
  mutate(infant_mortality_increased = infant_mortality_rate + 1)

print(cleaned_data)
4. With Underscore-Prefixed Columns
If needed, you can prefix underscores for special columns, such as placeholders.
# Adding a column with underscore prefix
data <- data %>%
  mutate(_temp_rate = infant_mortality_rate / 2)
print(data)
5. Assigning Functions to Variables
Underscores are also valid for function assignments.
# Assign a function to a variable with an underscore
calculate_rate <- function(x) x * 1000
mortality_rate_per_thousand <- calculate_rate(5.2)
print(mortality_rate_per_thousand)
6. As Separators in String Concatenation
Use underscores in strings to represent formatted variables or identifiers.
# Using underscores in strings
file_name <- paste("infant_mortality", "2022", sep = "_")
print(file_name)
By following these examples, you can effectively and appropriately use underscores in your R code to enhance readability and organization.

I mean in words, not code
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In written text, underscores in R are typically used for naming conventions to improve clarity and readability in variable, function, or column names. Here's a quick guide:

Usage in Words:
Readable Variable or Column Names:

Use underscores to separate words in names, making them easier to read.
Example:
Instead of: infantmortalityrate
Use: infant_mortality_rate
Consistent Naming Conventions:

In R, snake_case (using underscores) is widely used in place of camelCase (using capitalization).
Example:
maternal_age_group instead of maternalAgeGroup
Data Processing Tools:

Many R packages like dplyr, tidyr, and janitor recommend using underscores for naming objects, functions, and columns.
Example:
Column names: state_name, year_of_death, death_rate
Avoid Spaces or Special Characters:

Spaces and special characters (e.g., -, .) can cause issues in R code. Underscores are a safe alternative.
Example:
Replace Infant-Mortality-Rate with infant_mortality_rate
String Concatenation with Underscores:

If you need to construct identifiers or labels, underscores can be used as separators.
Example:
"infant", "mortality", "rate" combined as infant_mortality_rate
Writing with Underscores in Text:
When documenting or writing in a report or markdown, you can format underscores as follows:

Literal Display:

Use backticks (`) to display variable names exactly as they are in the code.
Example:
"The variable infant_mortality_rate represents the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births."
Explain the Purpose:

"We use underscores (e.g., state_name, year_of_death) to ensure the variables are self-explanatory and consistent."

A Survey-Based Qualitative Studies {#sec-survey}
Understanding the nuanced impacts of abortion bans and the overturn of Roe v. Wade on infant mortality rates requires a deeper exploration of the lived experiences of affected populations. Survey-based qualitative studies provide an opportunity to examine how restrictive abortion policies influence maternal health, healthcare access, and family well-being, going beyond the numbers presented by quantitative data.

For example, restrictive abortion laws may affect a mother's psychological condition, particularly in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies. Stress, anxiety, or depression resulting from forced pregnancies or the inability to access abortion services can compromise maternal mental health. This, in turn, may influence prenatal care decisions and behaviors, potentially affecting the survival and health of the infant. Exploring these dimensions through surveys with mothers, healthcare providers, and community organizations can offer valuable insights into the cascading effects of abortion bans on family dynamics and infant outcomes.

By incorporating qualitative data, such studies can provide policymakers and public health officials with a more comprehensive understanding of the far-reaching implications of abortion restrictions, ensuring that interventions address both the physical and emotional well-being of affected families.

A Survey-Based Qualitative Studies {#sec-survey}
This study proposes to examine the psychological and social dimensions of abortion bans by conducting surveys with mothers who were unable to access abortion services and subsequently experienced the death of their infant. Restrictive abortion laws may profoundly impact a mother’s psychological condition, particularly in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies. Stress, anxiety, or depression arising from forced pregnancies or the inability to terminate a pregnancy can significantly compromise maternal mental health.

These psychological challenges may, in turn, influence prenatal care decisions, access to healthcare, and overall maternal behavior during pregnancy—factors that are critical to the survival and health of the infant. Surveying affected mothers offers an opportunity to understand their lived experiences, including the mental health struggles, societal pressures, and systemic barriers they faced. The insights gained from these surveys can shed light on the cascading effects of restrictive abortion policies on maternal and infant health outcomes.

By also involving healthcare providers and support organizations, the survey aims to capture a holistic view of how systemic challenges and individual experiences intersect. These findings will help inform evidence-based interventions to address the psychological and healthcare needs of mothers and mitigate the adverse outcomes associated with abortion bans. This approach underscores the importance of combining quantitative data with qualitative insights to fully understand and address the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws.

Appendix: Survey-Based Augmentation of Observational Data
Our study primarily relies on observational data to analyze the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the United States following the Dobbs decision. While observational data provide valuable insights, they are subject to inherent limitations, such as confounding factors and challenges in establishing causal relationships. To address these limitations and enrich our study, we propose the incorporation of a survey to complement the observational data.

Limitations of Observational Data
Observational data can be influenced by factors outside the scope of the data collection process. For example:

Unmeasured Confounders: In our context, variations in healthcare access, social support systems, or pre-existing maternal health conditions may affect infant mortality rates, making it difficult to isolate the impact of abortion bans.
Reverse Causality: Observational data may not capture whether the changes in infant mortality rates are a cause or consequence of restrictive abortion laws.
Biases in Data Reporting: The data derived from administrative sources, such as birth and death certificates, may underreport or misclassify certain outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations.
Proposed Survey Design
To augment our analysis, we propose conducting a survey targeting mothers and healthcare providers. This survey aims to gather qualitative and quantitative data to address gaps in the observational dataset.

Sampling Approach
Target Population:
Primary Sample: Mothers who were denied abortion services due to legal restrictions and whose infants subsequently died.
Secondary Sample: Healthcare providers who have treated these mothers.
Sampling Method:
Stratified random sampling to ensure representation across demographics (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status) and geographic regions.
Oversampling in states where abortion bans were implemented after the Dobbs decision to capture more cases of interest.
Sample Size:
200-300 mothers for quantitative analysis and 30-50 mothers for in-depth qualitative interviews.
50-100 healthcare providers for complementary insights.
Survey Questions
Section 1: Demographics

Age, race, income, education, marital status, and geographic location.
Section 2: Maternal Experiences

Psychological impact of being denied abortion services.
Access to and utilization of prenatal and postnatal care.
Section 3: Healthcare Perspectives

Observations of healthcare providers regarding the impact of abortion bans on maternal and infant health outcomes.
Section 4: Perceptions and Behaviors

Attitudes toward healthcare systems and support structures.
Behavioral changes (e.g., adherence to prenatal care recommendations).
Implementation
Modes of Administration:
Online surveys for broad geographic reach.
In-person interviews for richer qualitative insights.
Ethical Considerations:
Obtain informed consent and ensure anonymity.
Provide mental health resources to participants.
Integration into Study
The survey data would augment our observational analysis by:

Identifying Unmeasured Confounders:
The survey responses can provide context for factors influencing maternal and infant health that are not captured in the administrative dataset.
Enhancing Interpretation of Results:
Insights from mothers’ lived experiences can help contextualize trends observed in the quantitative data.
Strengthening Causal Inference:
By comparing reported behaviors and experiences across respondents, we can better assess the causal pathways linking restrictive abortion laws to infant mortality.
Conclusion
This proposed survey-based augmentation represents an essential step toward addressing the limitations of observational data. By incorporating firsthand accounts and nuanced contextual factors, we aim to provide a more comprehensive and evidence-based understanding of the impacts of abortion bans on maternal and infant health outcomes. The insights gained can inform future research and guide policy interventions to reduce disparities and improve public health outcomes.

Restrictive abortion laws may exacerbate maternal stress, anxiety, or depression—especially in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies—potentially undermining maternal health and prenatal care. Research indicates that maternal mental health is a critical determinant of infant health outcomes, as conditions such as chronic stress, depression, or anxiety during pregnancy can negatively impact prenatal behaviors, access to healthcare, and overall maternal well-being. These psychological challenges, compounded by societal pressures and systemic barriers, can significantly increase the risk of adverse infant outcomes, including infant mortality. The survey will focus on mothers unable to access abortion services who subsequently experienced the death of their infant, documenting their experiences to better understand these interconnected factors.

To provide a comprehensive perspective, the study will also involve healthcare providers and support organizations, capturing insights into systemic challenges and the broader impacts of abortion bans on family healthcare. By combining these perspectives with mothers’ lived experiences, the survey aims to inform evidence-based interventions addressing maternal psychological and healthcare needs and mitigating the negative consequences of restrictive abortion policies.

This dual approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative methods, seeks to uncover the complex relationship between restrictive abortion laws, maternal mental health, and infant outcomes, forming the basis for effective policy recommendations.

## Objective

The objective of this study is to investigate the psychological, social, and systemic impacts of restrictive abortion laws on maternal health and infant outcomes. By focusing on mothers unable to access abortion services who experienced the death of their infant, the study aims to document lived experiences, explore the role of maternal stress and healthcare barriers in adverse outcomes, and gather perspectives from healthcare providers and support organizations. Understanding how maternal mental health directly affects prenatal care decisions, access to healthcare, and overall maternal behavior is essential to addressing the systemic factors contributing to higher infant mortality rates. The findings will guide the development of evidence-based strategies to improve maternal mental health, enhance healthcare access, and shape policy responses to restrictive abortion laws. write me a complete survey design

do you think snow ball sampling is suitable for this survey?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Yes, snowball sampling can be suitable for this survey, particularly given the sensitive and potentially stigmatized nature of the topic. However, its appropriateness depends on the study's objectives, target population, and practical considerations. Below, I outline why snowball sampling could be a good fit and some potential limitations:

Why Snowball Sampling is Suitable
Hard-to-Reach Population:

Mothers who were unable to access abortion services and subsequently experienced infant loss are likely a difficult group to identify using conventional sampling methods.
These individuals may not be readily accessible through traditional sample frames, making snowball sampling an effective approach to leverage existing networks.
Sensitive Topic:

Discussing abortion restrictions and infant loss is highly personal and sensitive. Snowball sampling allows researchers to gain trust by initiating recruitment through individuals or organizations already connected to potential participants.
This method reduces the likelihood of rejection since participants are referred by someone they know.
Small, Defined Population:

The study targets a relatively small and specific population (e.g., mothers in states with abortion bans post-Dobbs decision). Snowball sampling is efficient for studying such niche populations.
Leveraging Community Networks:

Advocacy groups, healthcare providers, and support organizations are often tightly knit communities. These groups can act as initial "seeds" for snowball sampling, helping the survey reach more participants.
Implementation in the Study
Initial Seeds:

Start with known contacts, such as individuals identified through support groups, healthcare providers, or community organizations.
Use a diverse set of seeds to ensure variation in geography, socioeconomic background, race/ethnicity, and other demographics.
Referral Process:

Ask each participant to refer others who meet the inclusion criteria (e.g., mothers affected by abortion bans and experiencing infant loss).
Maintain anonymity and confidentiality during referrals to protect participants’ privacy.
Incentives:

Offer small incentives (e.g., gift cards, donations to a charity) to encourage participation and referrals without coercion.
Limitations of Snowball Sampling
Selection Bias:

Snowball sampling is non-probabilistic, meaning the sample may overrepresent certain groups (e.g., individuals connected to advocacy organizations) while underrepresenting others (e.g., those without community ties).
Homogeneity in Networks:

Participants are likely to refer individuals within their social circles, leading to a sample that may not fully capture the diversity of the target population.
Generalizability:

Results obtained through snowball sampling may not be generalizable to the broader population due to the non-random nature of the sampling.
Mitigation Strategies
Use Mixed Methods:

Complement snowball sampling with other techniques, such as purposive sampling, to ensure representation from underrepresented groups.
For example, reach out to healthcare providers to identify individuals who may not be part of advocacy networks.
Set Diversity Targets:

Establish quotas to ensure the sample includes diverse participants in terms of geography, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and maternal age.
Monitor Sampling Progress:

Regularly assess the sample's diversity and adjust recruitment efforts as needed to address gaps.
Transparency:

Clearly acknowledge the limitations of snowball sampling in the study and avoid making overly broad generalizations from the results.
Conclusion
Snowball sampling is a viable approach for this survey due to its ability to reach hard-to-access populations and foster trust in a sensitive research context. However, it should be combined with other methods and carefully monitored to address potential biases and ensure a diverse, representative sample.

Respondent-driven sampling
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is an enhanced form of snowball sampling that incorporates statistical techniques to address some of the biases associated with non-random sampling methods. It is particularly well-suited for studies involving hard-to-reach or stigmatized populations, making it a viable option for your survey on the psychological and social impacts of abortion bans.

What is Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS)?
RDS is a peer-recruitment method where initial participants (seeds) recruit additional participants from their social networks, with recruitment continuing through multiple waves. Unlike traditional snowball sampling, RDS collects information about the size and structure of participants’ networks and uses this data to adjust for biases and improve representativeness.

Why RDS is Suitable for This Survey
Access to Hidden Populations:

Mothers affected by abortion bans and subsequent infant loss may not readily identify themselves, making RDS a good choice to reach participants through trusted networks.
Sensitivity of the Topic:

Peer-to-peer recruitment can build trust and encourage participation in a study on a sensitive topic like abortion and infant mortality.
Improved Generalizability:

By collecting network data (e.g., how many people the respondent knows who meet the inclusion criteria), RDS can adjust for overrepresentation of certain groups and make findings more generalizable.
Diverse Recruitment:

RDS helps capture diversity in the population by recruiting through multiple waves and accessing different social networks.
Sampling Efficiency:

RDS allows researchers to reach a larger sample size with fewer initial seeds compared to traditional methods, as participants continue to recruit on behalf of the study.
How to Implement RDS for This Survey
Designate Initial Seeds:

Choose a small, diverse group of initial participants ("seeds") from different demographics, regions, and experiences (e.g., age, race, socioeconomic status).
Seeds can be identified through community organizations, healthcare providers, or advocacy groups.
Recruitment Process:

Each seed is given a fixed number of recruitment coupons (usually 3–5) to invite others they know who meet the inclusion criteria.
Each recruited participant is then given additional coupons to continue the process.
Limit the number of recruitment waves to balance efficiency and manageability.
Compensation:

Provide incentives for both participation and successful recruitment. For example:
$X for completing the survey.
$Y for each additional participant they successfully recruit (tracked via coupon IDs).
Ensure incentives are ethical and avoid coercion.
Network Data Collection:

Ask each participant about the size of their social network (e.g., "How many people do you know who fit the inclusion criteria?").
This data will be used to weight the sample during analysis to adjust for differences in recruitment likelihood.
Survey Design:

Include questions about participants' experiences with abortion bans, psychological impacts, healthcare access, and infant loss.
Ensure anonymity and confidentiality, given the sensitive nature of the topic.
End Recruitment:

Stop recruitment when the sample size is sufficient, or when equilibrium is reached (i.e., when the sample composition stabilizes across recruitment waves).
Advantages of RDS
Statistical Adjustments:

Unlike snowball sampling, RDS incorporates statistical weighting to make the sample more representative of the broader population.
Extended Reach:

Recruitment extends beyond the initial seeds, potentially accessing networks that would otherwise be missed.
Diversity in Sample:

Encourages participation from various subpopulations, reducing the risk of homogeneity.
Trust-Building:

Participants are more likely to trust the study and participate when recruited by someone they know.
Limitations of RDS
Recruitment Bias:

RDS still relies on social networks, which may not fully capture the target population's diversity.
Dependence on Social Networks:

The method assumes participants have networks of people who meet the inclusion criteria, which may not always be the case.
Complexity:

RDS requires careful monitoring of recruitment, coupon distribution, and data collection, which can be resource-intensive.
Anonymity Challenges:

Tracking recruitment via coupons may introduce minor risks to anonymity if not managed carefully.
Steps to Analyze RDS Data
Adjust for Recruitment Probability:

Use the network size data collected to weight responses and correct for biases in recruitment likelihood.
Equilibrium Check:

Confirm that the sample composition stabilizes after a few waves, indicating that the sample is representative of the population.
Statistical Models:

Use software packages like RDS Analyst or R packages like RDS to analyze the data and compute population estimates.
Conclusion
Respondent-Driven Sampling is a powerful method for accessing hard-to-reach populations like mothers affected by abortion bans and subsequent infant loss. It addresses many limitations of traditional snowball sampling by incorporating statistical adjustments and leveraging social networks. While resource-intensive, RDS is well-suited for your study's goals and the sensitive nature of the subject matter.

Respondent-driven sampling was developed by Heckathorn (1997) to focus on hidden populations, which are those where:

there is no sampling frame; and
being known to be in the sampling population could have a negative effect.
For instance, we could imagine various countries in which it would be difficult to sample from, say, the gay population or those who have had abortions. Respondent-driven sampling differs from snowball sampling in two ways:

In addition to compensation for their own response, as is the case with snowball sampling, respondent-driven sampling typically also involves compensation for recruiting others.
Respondents are not asked to provide information about others to the investigator, but instead recruit them into the study. Selection into the sample occurs not from sampling frame, but instead from the networks of those already in the sample (Salganik and Heckathorn 2004).
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Respondent-driven sampling (RDS), introduced by Heckathorn (1997), was specifically designed to address the challenges of studying hidden populations. Hidden populations are defined by two primary characteristics:

Lack of a Sampling Frame: There is no comprehensive list or register of the population, making traditional sampling methods infeasible.
Potential Negative Consequences of Disclosure: Being identified as a member of the population (e.g., those who have had abortions or individuals from marginalized communities) could lead to stigma, discrimination, or other harmful outcomes.
Differences Between Respondent-Driven Sampling and Snowball Sampling
While both RDS and snowball sampling involve participants recruiting others, RDS includes key enhancements that improve its methodology and results:

Dual Compensation:

In RDS, participants are compensated not only for their participation but also for successfully recruiting others. This creates an incentive for broader recruitment and enhances the reach of the sample.
Recruitment Process:

Unlike snowball sampling, where respondents provide contact information for others, RDS relies on peer recruitment. Participants invite others from their social networks to join the study, typically using recruitment coupons. This ensures that selection into the sample is mediated through social connections rather than direct investigator involvement.
How RDS Operates
Selection into the sample is driven by the networks of individuals already included in the study (Salganik and Heckathorn 2004).
By collecting information about participants’ social networks (e.g., the number of people they know who meet the inclusion criteria), RDS enables researchers to statistically adjust for biases introduced by non-random recruitment, making it more representative of the population.
Applications
For example, in contexts where accessing sensitive populations is challenging—such as individuals who have had abortions in countries with restrictive laws—RDS provides a methodologically robust and ethically sensitive way to recruit participants. It also ensures confidentiality by eliminating the need for participants to disclose others’ identities directly to researchers.

By leveraging social networks and dual compensation, RDS provides an innovative approach to studying hidden populations, balancing accessibility, representativeness, and ethical considerations.

By collecting data on participants’ social networks, RDS allows for statistical adjustments to reduce biases, making the sample more representative of the broader population. This method is particularly valuable for sensitive topics, such as abortion, where individuals may face stigma or legal repercussions, as it maintains confidentiality while leveraging peer connections.

why we use RDS for our survey?

2/2

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
We use Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) for our survey because it is well-suited for reaching hidden or stigmatized populations, such as mothers who were unable to access abortion services and experienced the death of their infant. These individuals may be difficult to identify through conventional methods due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the lack of a clear sampling frame.

RDS leverages peer networks, allowing participants to recruit others they trust, fostering higher participation rates in populations that may distrust external researchers. This approach helps maintain confidentiality and reduces the risk of social stigma. Additionally, RDS provides a structured framework for statistical adjustments, mitigating biases inherent in network-based recruitment, and improving the representativeness of the sample. These advantages make RDS an effective and ethical choice for gathering insights into the psychological, social, and systemic impacts of restrictive abortion laws.

sample frame
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Sample Frame for the Survey
A sample frame is a comprehensive list or set of criteria used to identify the population from which the survey sample will be drawn. In the context of this study, which focuses on mothers who were unable to access abortion services and subsequently experienced the death of their infant, the sample frame is inherently challenging due to the sensitive nature of the topic and the lack of an easily identifiable population.

Components of the Sample Frame
Target Population:

Mothers who:
Were unable to access abortion services due to restrictive laws.
Experienced the death of their infant within the first year of life.
Healthcare providers and organizations that supported or treated these mothers.
Characteristics for Inclusion:

Mothers:
Reside in states with restrictive abortion laws (post-Dobbs decision).
Experienced barriers to accessing abortion services.
Infant mortality occurred within the past 1–2 years.
Healthcare Providers:
Directly involved in maternal or infant care in states with restrictive abortion laws.
Support Organizations:
Provide resources or advocacy for women navigating restrictive abortion policies.
Challenges with the Sample Frame:

Hidden Population:
The population is not readily identifiable in existing datasets.
Stigma or privacy concerns may prevent individuals from coming forward.
Lack of a Formal Register:
No existing administrative or healthcare record systematically tracks mothers who meet the above criteria.
Sampling Methodology to Address Challenges
To address the difficulties of creating a formal sample frame for this hidden population, Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) or snowball sampling is proposed. These methods are well-suited for populations that lack a clear sampling frame and involve sensitive or stigmatized topics.

Starting Points: Initial participants (seeds) will be identified through healthcare providers, community organizations, or advocacy groups.
Recruitment: Participants will be encouraged to invite others in their networks who meet the criteria, creating a chain of referrals.
This approach allows the study to capture the lived experiences of a population that is otherwise challenging to survey while mitigating the limitations of not having a formal sample frame.

You said:
so what's sample frame for our study?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The sample frame for this study is composed of individuals who meet the following criteria:

Mothers who were denied abortion services:

These are individuals who attempted to access abortion services but were unable to due to restrictive abortion laws in their state or region following the Dobbs decision (or similar legislative changes).
Experienced infant mortality:

Among these mothers, the focus is specifically on those who experienced the death of their infant within the first year of life.
Geographic scope:

The sample is limited to mothers residing in states with abortion bans or restrictions enforced after the Dobbs decision, such as Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, and similar states with comparable policies.
Accessible through community networks:

Mothers who can be identified through community healthcare providers, support groups, advocacy organizations, or social networks that cater to individuals affected by restrictive abortion laws.
Why This Sample Frame?
The population of interest—mothers denied abortion services and who subsequently experienced infant mortality—is a hidden population, meaning it is not directly observable or easily accessible through traditional sampling methods.
The focus on states with abortion bans ensures relevance to the study's objective of examining the impacts of restrictive abortion laws.
The involvement of community organizations and healthcare providers helps to mitigate the challenges of identifying eligible participants in a stigmatized and sensitive area of study.
Challenges with This Sample Frame
Hidden population: No comprehensive database exists for mothers meeting these criteria, making it challenging to identify them without relying on social or healthcare networks.
Sensitive topic: Stigma and emotional distress related to abortion and infant mortality may limit participation.
Given these challenges, Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is appropriate to access this population effectively while ensuring ethical and inclusive participation.

Here is the explanation and structure of the provided code:

Code Breakdown
Loading the Pre-trained Model:

library(rstanarm)
This loads the rstanarm library, which is used for Bayesian regression and inference.
Ensure that the pre_trained_model is loaded into your R environment before running the predictions.
Creating New Data for Prediction:

new_data <- data.frame(
  after_injunction = c(0, 1),
  abortion_illegal = c(0, 1),
  age_of_mother = c(25, 30),
  mothers_single_race = c("White", "Black"),
  year_of_death = c(2021, 2022)
)
This creates a data frame of new observations for which predictions will be made.
Columns include the variables from the model: after_injunction, abortion_illegal, age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, and year_of_death.
Making Predictions:

predictions <- posterior_predict(pre_trained_model, newdata = new_data)
The posterior_predict function generates posterior predictive samples based on the pre-trained model (pre_trained_model) and the new_data.
Each row in predictions corresponds to a prediction for the corresponding row in new_data.
Printing Predictions:

print(predictions)
This outputs the predicted values for the new data.
Expected Output
The predictions will be a matrix with:

Rows: Corresponding to the number of observations in new_data (e.g., 2 rows in this case).
Columns: Representing posterior samples (e.g., 4000 samples, depending on your model configuration).
Example output might look like:

       [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  ...
[1,]   8.23  8.50  8.12  ...
[2,]  10.15 10.28 10.05  ...
Notes
Pre-trained Model: Ensure that pre_trained_model is the correct model loaded into the environment.

Load it using load("path_to_model.RData") if saved as an R object.
Data Matching: The new_data must have columns that match the predictors used in training the pre_trained_model.

Interpreting Results:

Each entry in the matrix represents one sample from the posterior predictive distribution for that observation.
You can summarize predictions using means, medians, or credible intervals (e.g., apply(predictions, 1, mean) for means).

To adjust the code to match the column structure of your dataset (death_rate, after_injunction, abortion_illegal, state, age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, year_of_death, and month), here is the updated version:

Updated Code
# Load pre-trained model
library(rstanarm)

# Example new data for prediction
new_data <- data.frame(
  death_rate = NA,  # Placeholder for dependent variable
  after_injunction = c(0, 1),  # Binary indicator for post-injunction period
  abortion_illegal = c(0, 1),  # Binary indicator for abortion legality
  state = c("Texas", "California"),  # Example states
  age_of_mother = c(25, 30),  # Mother's age
  mothers_single_race = c("White", "Black"),  # Mother's race
  year_of_death = c(2021, 2022),  # Year of infant's death
  month = c(6, 7)  # Month of infant's death
)

# Make predictions using the pre-trained model
predictions <- posterior_predict(pre_trained_model, newdata = new_data)

# Print predictions
print(predictions)
Explanation of Adjustments
death_rate:

Included as NA since it's the dependent variable being predicted. The model does not use this during predictions.
after_injunction:

Binary variable (0 for pre-injunction and 1 for post-injunction).
abortion_illegal:

Binary variable (0 for legal abortion and 1 for illegal abortion).
state:

State of the mother’s residence (e.g., "Texas", "California").
age_of_mother:

Age of the mother in years.
mothers_single_race:

Race of the mother (e.g., "White", "Black").
year_of_death and month:

Year and month of the infant’s death. These can capture temporal trends in the model.
NA Placeholder for Dependent Variable:

The death_rate column is filled with NA as it is the value being predicted by the model.
Notes for Predictions
Output: predictions will be a matrix of posterior predictive samples for each row in new_data. Each column represents one sample from the posterior distribution.

State Matching: Ensure the state variable in new_data matches the format in your model training data (e.g., abbreviation vs full name).

Summarizing Predictions:

apply(predictions, 1, mean)  # Get mean predictions for each row
apply(predictions, 1, quantile, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))  # 95% credible intervals
Dependent Variable Validation: If you later compare predictions to actual values, ensure death_rate is added to the dataset with the true values.

Simulated Data for Infant Mortality Study:
Columns:

death_rate, after_injunction, abortion_illegal, state, age_of_mother, mothers_single_race, year_of_death, month, sample_size
Variable Specifications:

death_rate should be between 0 and 50 (representing deaths per 1,000 live births).
after_injunction should be one of: 0 (before injunction) or 1 (after injunction).
abortion_illegal should be one of: 0 (legal abortion) or 1 (illegal abortion).
state should be valid US state abbreviations (e.g., "TX", "CA").
age_of_mother should be one of: 15–19, 20–24, 25–29, 30–34, 35–39, 40–44, 45+.
mothers_single_race should be one of: "White", "Black", "Asian", "Native American", "Pacific Islander", "More than one race", "Unknown or Not Stated".
year_of_death should be one of: 2021, 2022.
month should be a numeric value between 1 (January) and 12 (December).
sample_size should be between 0 and 5,000 (representing the number of live births).
Example Data Constraints:
death_rate: Represents the infant deaths per 1,000 live births. Values should remain realistic and within the range typically observed in public health data.

after_injunction & abortion_illegal: Binary variables indicating whether the observation occurred after the Dobbs decision and whether abortion was illegal in the respective state.

state: Use standardized abbreviations for US states (e.g., "TX" for Texas, "CA" for California).

age_of_mother: Categorical representation of maternal age grouped into meaningful intervals for public health analysis.

mothers_single_race: Reflects the mother's self-reported race as recorded in the dataset. Ensure categories align with the CDC’s classifications.

year_of_death & month: Include temporal variables to capture the time-specific trends and seasonality in infant mortality rates.

sample_size: Include this variable for weighting or statistical adjustments, ensuring values are reasonable for the population size.

Example Row:
death_rate	after_injunction	abortion_illegal	state	age_of_mother	mothers_single_race	year_of_death	month	sample_size
7.3	1	1	TX	25–29	Black	2022	7	1,245
This simulated structure is designed to support robust modeling and analysis of the effects of restrictive abortion laws on infant mortality rates, providing a clear and interpretable dataset for further research.

The error indicates that the state variable in sample(state, ...) is not defined. To resolve this, you can use state.abb, which contains abbreviations for all U.S. states, as the source for sampling. Here's the corrected code:

# Define the list of states where abortion is illegal
illegal_states <- c("AL", "AR", "ID", "IN", "KY", "LA", "MS", "OK", "SD", "TN", "TX", "WV")

# Simulate data
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  death_rate = runif(700, min = 0, max = 50),
  state = factor(sample(state.abb, size = 700, replace = TRUE)), # Use state.abb for state abbreviations
  age_of_mother = sample(c("15–19", "20–24", "25–29", "30–34", "35–39", "40–44", "45+"), 700, replace = TRUE),
  mothers_single_race = sample(c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Native American", "Pacific Islander", 
                                 "More than one race", "Unknown or Not Stated"), 700, replace = TRUE),
  year_of_death = sample(c(2021, 2022), 700, replace = TRUE),
  month = sample(1:12, 700, replace = TRUE)

Key Fixes:
State Sampling: Used state.abb, a built-in R variable containing valid state abbreviations, for the state column.
Mutation with mutate: Added after_injunction and abortion_illegal columns directly to the simulated_data dataframe after its creation.
Illegal States Abbreviation: Ensured that illegal_states matches the format of state.abb.
Outputs:
death_rate: Random values between 0 and 50.
state: Abbreviations sampled from state.abb.
after_injunction and abortion_illegal: Categorical variables created based on year_of_death, month, and state.

The code has a minor issue: states is not defined in the script. To fix this, you can use the built-in variable state.abb, which contains valid U.S. state abbreviations. Here's the corrected code:

# Define the list of states where abortion is illegal
illegal_states <- c("AL", "AR", "ID", "IN", "KY", "LA", "MS", "OK", "SD", "TN", "TX", "WV")

# Corrected simulated data generation
simulated_data <- data.frame(
  death_rate = runif(700, min = 0, max = 50),
  state = factor(sample(state.abb, size = 700, replace = TRUE)), # Use state.abb for valid U.S. states
  age_of_mother = sample(c("15–19", "20–24", "25–29", "30–34", "35–39", "40–44", "45+"), 700, replace = TRUE),

Key Changes:
State Sampling: Replaced states with state.abb, a built-in R variable containing U.S. state abbreviations.
Illegal States Definition: Made sure that illegal_states uses state abbreviations matching state.abb.
Pipeline Operator (|> and mutate): Ensured that the mutate function processes the data correctly after its creation.
Explanation:
state: Samples state abbreviations from state.abb.
after_injunction: A binary factor indicating whether the death occurred after June 2022.
abortion_illegal: A binary factor indicating whether abortion was illegal in the sampled state.
This corrected code should run without issues and produce the desired simulated dataset.

Row Check: Adjusted to ensure the simulated data has 700 rows.
Expected Columns: Defined the expected column names to ensure they match the simulation.
State Validation: Validates state abbreviations against state.abb.
Binary Columns: Ensures after_injunction and abortion_illegal are binary.
Data Ranges: Validates month, death_rate, year_of_death, and categorical columns (age_of_mother, mothers_single_race).
This script verifies that your simulated dataset meets the expected structure and content before proceeding to analysis.

Here is the revised script with the logic to ensure that abortion_illegal is correctly set based on whether the state is in illegal_states:

#### Workspace setup ####
library(tidyverse)

#### Define the list of states where abortion is illegal ####
illegal_states <- c("AL", "AR", "ID", "IN", "KY", "LA", "MS", "OK", "SD", "TN", "TX", "WV")

#### Load data ####
analysis_data <- read_csv("data/00-simulated_data/simulated_data.csv")

# Ensure `abortion_illegal` is correctly set based on `illegal_states`
analysis_data <- analysis_data %>%
  mutate(
    abortion_illegal = as.factor(if_else(state %in% illegal_states, 1, 0))
  )

# Test if the data was successfully loaded and modified
if (exists("analysis_data")) {
  message("Test Passed: The dataset was successfully loaded and modified.")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The dataset could not be loaded or modified.")
}

#### Test data ####

# Check if the dataset has 700 rows (expected based on simulation)
if (nrow(analysis_data) == 700) {
  message("Test Passed: The dataset has 700 rows.")
} else {
  stop(paste("Test Failed: The dataset has", nrow(analysis_data), "rows instead of 700."))

# Check if `abortion_illegal` matches the logic for `illegal_states`
if (all((analysis_data$state %in% illegal_states & analysis_data$abortion_illegal == 1) |

  message("Test Passed: The `abortion_illegal` column is consistent with `illegal_states`.")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The `abortion_illegal` column does not match the `illegal_states` logic.")
}

#### Summary of Tests ####
message("All tests completed successfully.")
Key Updates:
Ensure abortion_illegal Consistency: The mutate function recalculates abortion_illegal based on whether the state is in illegal_states. If the state is illegal, abortion_illegal is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0.
Validation Test: A specific test checks that all rows in the dataset comply with the logic for abortion_illegal.
This ensures that the dataset's abortion_illegal field is accurate before proceeding with further analysis.

Key Updates:
abortion_illegal: Updated using the logic that states in illegal_states have abortion_illegal = 1; otherwise, it's 0.
after_injunction: Updated using the logic that rows with year_of_death >= 2022 and month >= 6 have after_injunction = 1; otherwise, it's 0.
Validation Tests:
Check that abortion_illegal aligns with illegal_states.
Verify that after_injunction is consistent with the year_of_death and month logic.
This ensures the dataset is accurate and ready for further analysis.

      OBS_VALUE = col_double(), write col type for my read.csv
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To specify column types for read.csv, you can use the colClasses argument. Here's how you would structure it for your example:

data <- read.csv(
  "your_file.csv",
  colClasses = c(
    "Geographic area" = "character",
    "TIME_PERIOD" = "character",
    "OBS_VALUE" = "numeric"
  )
)
Explanation:
character: For columns like Geographic area and TIME_PERIOD that store text data.
numeric: For columns like OBS_VALUE that store numerical data.
Full Example:
data <- read.csv(
  "your_file.csv",
  header = TRUE,                # Include if the file has a header row
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE,     # Prevent automatic conversion to factors
  colClasses = c(
    "Geographic area" = "character",
    "TIME_PERIOD" = "character",
    "OBS_VALUE" = "numeric"
  )
)
If the column names have spaces or special characters, make sure to wrap them in backticks (`) as shown in the example above.

} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The 'month_code' column contains invalid values.")
}
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
This code snippet ensures that the month_code column contains valid month values (between 1 and 12) by performing a logical check on all entries in the column. Below is a detailed explanation and improved format using testthat:

Explanation:
Condition: analysis_data$month_code >= 1 & analysis_data$month_code <= 12
Checks if every value in the month_code column falls between 1 (January) and 12 (December).
all(): Ensures that every entry satisfies the condition.
message(): Prints a success message if the condition is met.
stop(): Terminates execution with an error message if the condition fails.
Using testthat
Here’s how to rewrite it as a testthat test:

library(testthat)

test_that("month_code contains valid month values", {
  expect_true(all(analysis_data$month_code >= 1 & analysis_data$month_code <= 12),
              info = "The 'month_code' column contains invalid values.")
})
Key Benefits:
Integration: Easily integrates with other tests in a test suite.
Readability: Clearly states the expectation (expect_true).
Scalability: Allows testing multiple conditions systematically.
This format is more robust for automated testing workflows.







You said:
# Check if 'month' column contains values between Janunary and December
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's how you can implement a test to ensure the 'month' column contains only valid values (between 1 and 12):

Using Base R
# Check if 'month' column contains values between January and December
if (all(analysis_data$month >= 1 & analysis_data$month <= 12)) {
  message("Test Passed: The 'month' column contains only valid months (1–12).")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The 'month' column contains invalid values.")
}
Using testthat
For better integration with automated testing, use the testthat framework:

library(testthat)

test_that("month column contains valid month values", {
  expect_true(all(analysis_data$month >= 1 & analysis_data$month <= 12), 
              info = "The 'month' column contains invalid values.")
})
Explanation:
analysis_data$month >= 1 & analysis_data$month <= 12:
Checks that all values in the month column fall within the range of valid months (1 to 12).
all():
Ensures that every entry in the month column satisfies the condition.
expect_true() (in testthat):
Asserts that the logical condition is TRUE for all entries.
Error Handling:
Base R uses stop() for errors.
testthat uses assertions (expect_* functions) with better output for debugging.
Choose the approach based on whether you're building a one-off script (Base R) or integrating into a testing framework (testthat).







You said:
I want from jan to december, worsds
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To check if the month column contains values as words (e.g., "January", "February", ..., "December"), you can use the following code:

Using Base R
# Define valid month names
valid_months <- c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
                  "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")

# Check if 'month' column contains only valid month names
if (all(analysis_data$month %in% valid_months)) {
  message("Test Passed: The 'month' column contains only valid month names (January–December).")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The 'month' column contains invalid month names.")
}
Using testthat
library(testthat)

test_that("month column contains valid month names", {
  valid_months <- c("January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June",
                    "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December")
  expect_true(all(analysis_data$month %in% valid_months), 
              info = "The 'month' column contains invalid month names.")
})
Explanation:
valid_months:
A vector of valid month names as words.
%in%:
Checks if each entry in the month column is in the list of valid_months.
all():
Ensures that every entry in the month column matches one of the valid month names.
Error Handling:
Base R uses stop() to indicate a failure.
testthat uses expect_true() to validate the condition and provides detailed output for debugging.
This ensures the month column contains only valid month names in word format from "January" to "December".

test na
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To test for NA values in a dataset column (e.g., month), you can use the following approaches:

Base R Approach
# Check for NA values in the 'month' column
if (all(!is.na(analysis_data$month))) {
  message("Test Passed: The 'month' column contains no NA values.")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The 'month' column contains NA values.")
}
testthat Approach
library(testthat)

test_that("month column contains no NA values", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(analysis_data$month)), 
              info = "The 'month' column contains NA values.")
})
To Test NA Across the Entire Dataset
Base R
# Check if the entire dataset contains NA values
if (all(!is.na(analysis_data))) {
  message("Test Passed: The dataset contains no NA values.")
} else {
  stop("Test Failed: The dataset contains NA values.")
}
testthat
test_that("dataset contains no NA values", {
  expect_true(all(!is.na(analysis_data)), 
              info = "The dataset contains NA values.")
})
Explanation
is.na():
Identifies NA values in the column or dataset.
all(!is.na(...)):
Checks that all values are not NA.
Error Handling:
stop() stops execution and provides an error message in Base R.
testthat::expect_true() checks the condition and returns a detailed error message if the condition fails.
Column-Specific vs Dataset-Wide:
Apply is.na() to specific columns to target individual checks or the entire dataset for a broader validation.
This ensures your data does not have missing values (NA).

    )
  ) this is example, than write analysis_data <- read_csv("data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv")
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Here's the equivalent script for reading analysis_data using read_csv with specified column types:

analysis_data <- read_csv(
  file = "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    death_rate = col_double(),
    after_injunction = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1")),
    abortion_illegal = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1")),
    state = col_character(),
    age_of_mother = col_character(),
    mothers_single_race = col_character(),
    year_of_death = col_integer(),
    month = col_integer()
  )
)
Explanation of col_types:
col_double(): For numeric continuous variables like death_rate.
col_factor(levels = c("0", "1")): For binary variables like after_injunction and abortion_illegal, ensuring proper factor encoding.
col_character(): For categorical string data like state, age_of_mother, and mothers_single_race.
col_integer(): For integer values like year_of_death and month.
This ensures that your analysis_data is read with the correct column types, preserving the expected structure for analysis.

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The warning message indicates that there might be some issues with how your analysis_data is being parsed. To troubleshoot and fix the issue:

Steps to Address Parsing Issues:
Call problems(): After reading the data into analysis_data, run:

problems(analysis_data)
This will provide details about which rows or columns caused parsing issues and why.

Inspect the Problematic Rows: Review the output of problems() to identify rows or cells with inconsistent data. Common issues include:

Non-numeric values in columns expected to be numeric.
Unexpected text or NA values.
Correct Column Specifications: If you notice specific columns are causing the issue, adjust the col_types argument in read_csv() accordingly. For example:

Use col_guess() for columns with mixed data types.
Explicitly handle missing or unexpected values with col_character().
Clean the Data Before Reading: If you can inspect the raw file (data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv), look for anomalies in the problematic rows and fix them. Alternatively, you can preprocess the file in R after loading.

Re-read the Data: After fixing any issues, re-run read_csv() to ensure no warnings.

Example of Handling Parsing Issues:
analysis_data <- read_csv(
  file = "data/02-analysis_data/analysis_data.csv",
  col_types = cols(
    death_rate = col_double(),
    after_injunction = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1")),
    abortion_illegal = col_factor(levels = c("0", "1")),
    state = col_character(),
    age_of_mother = col_character(),
    mothers_single_race = col_character(),
    year_of_death = col_integer(),
    month = col_integer()
  )
)

# Check for parsing problems
problems(analysis_data)
If Parsing Issues Persist:
If the issues are complex or the data structure is inconsistent:

Inspect the raw CSV file for patterns or issues.
Use readr::read_csv() with minimal type restrictions (e.g., col_types = cols(.default = col_character())) to load the data as text, then clean and convert columns in R.
This process will help you resolve the parsing warnings and ensure your data is read correctly.

Efforts outside the United States have often relied on indirect estimation methods or methods that obscure individual respondents' answers (such as the list experiment); however, these approaches generally can only estimate overall prevalence, as they cannot be linked to individual women's reports. 3 , 28 These methods have had inconsistent results and few U.S. applications exist. 29 , 30 , 31 European studies have made some efforts to alter question‐wording or order to improve abortion, but with limited impact. 4 , 5 Given the persistent problems of substantial abortion underreporting and minimal advances in abortion measurement in the United States in more than two decades, we designed several new approaches to eliciting abortion reporting and tested each in an individual‐level national survey. These approaches included changes to both the design and placement of abortion question items, as these components have been shown to influence the reporting of sensitive behaviors. 19 , 32 We concentrated on altering the sensitivity of questions about abortion and thus the related social desirability bias, the sense of intrusiveness of asking about abortion, respondents' motivation to report, or respondents' comprehension or judgment of which experiences to report as abortion.  write a summary for this

Efforts outside the United States have predominantly used indirect estimation techniques, like list experiments, to measure abortion prevalence, but these methods generally lack the ability to connect findings to individual respondents. While such approaches have produced inconsistent results and have limited application in the U.S., European studies have attempted modifications in question wording and order with minimal success. Given the persistent challenges of abortion underreporting and the lack of advancements in abortion measurement in the U.S. over the past two decades, researchers developed and tested new approaches in a national survey. These strategies involved altering the design and placement of abortion-related questions to reduce sensitivity, social desirability bias, and perceived intrusiveness, while improving respondents' understanding and willingness to report accurately.

Building from our foundational mixed‐methods research, 35 , 39 we identified six experimental approaches to test in a newly designed national survey. The first experimental approach tested different placements of the abortion question item within the survey. Changes to the question design included altering the order of pregnancy outcome questions, the level of detail requested, the introduction to the abortion question, the context of the abortion question, and questions using graduated sensitivity. We compared the experimental conditions for question design to a control condition mirroring the current NSFG question‐wording; there was no explicit control condition for question placement. Below we describe each approach and an overview of the motivation for its use; we present complete questions in Table A1.

Abortion, or even considering abortion, carries significant social stigma. Therefore, our survey requires extremely careful phrasing and design to minimize this stigma's impact on the study of abortion, pregnancy, fertility, and related demographic and health outcomes. In Lindberg et al. (2022), researchers tested innovative methods in a national survey to address persistent underreporting of abortion in the U.S., focusing on question design and placement to reduce sensitivity, social desirability bias, and perceived intrusiveness. Although none of their experimental approaches significantly improved abortion reporting compared to the control condition, their study offers valuable insights for improving abortion measurement. We aim to adapt our survey design based on their methodologies to enhance data accuracy and respondent comfort.

ChatGPT
This survey is designed to explore the sensitive and complex impacts of restrictive abortion laws on maternal mental health and infant outcomes, while minimizing social desirability bias and respondent discomfort. The inclusion of carefully crafted, neutral questions ensures that participants feel safe sharing their experiences without fear of judgment. Drawing inspiration from Lindberg et al. (2022), the survey integrates strategies such as question placement, phrasing, and options to opt out (e.g., "Prefer not to say") to address the challenges of underreporting in studies involving stigmatized topics. By incorporating both multiple-choice and open-ended questions, the survey balances structured data collection with opportunities for respondents to express nuanced perspectives. These design choices aim to maximize data accuracy, foster trust with participants, and provide actionable insights into the cascading effects of abortion restrictions on maternal and infant health.







You said:
These studies found that respondents most preferred an introduction that focused on how sharing their abortion experience in a survey could help improve health services for other women. 35 This informed the design for this study of an introduction that uses the “helping” framework. We hypothesized this introduction could improve reporting by increasing survey participants' motivation to respond accurately and help others. 19
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Previous studies highlighted that respondents were more willing to share their abortion experiences when introduced to the survey through a "helping" framework, emphasizing how their responses could contribute to improving health services for other women. Building on this, the current survey incorporates a similar introduction to enhance participants' motivation to provide accurate and meaningful responses, fostering a sense of contribution and reducing the stigma associated with the topic. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that aligning survey participation with a purpose of helping others encourages honest and thoughtful reporting.

This survey is designed to explore the sensitive and complex impacts of restrictive abortion laws on maternal mental health and infant outcomes, while minimizing social desirability bias and respondent discomfort. The inclusion of carefully crafted, neutral questions ensures that participants feel safe sharing their experiences without fear of judgment. Drawing inspiration from @lindberg2022, the survey integrates strategies such as question placement, phrasing, and options to opt out (e.g., “Prefer not to say”) to address the challenges of underreporting in studies involving stigmatized topics. By incorporating both multiple-choice and open-ended questions, the survey balances structured data collection with opportunities for respondents to express nuanced perspectives. These design choices aim to maximize data accuracy, foster trust with participants, and provide actionable insights into the cascading effects of abortion restrictions on maternal and infant health. concise

## Target Population

Our target population is mothers who sought but were unable to access
abortion services due to restrictive laws and experienced the death of
their infant within the first year of life in states with abortion bans
following the Dobbs decision.

## Sample frame

Given the sensitive nature of our study, identifying and reaching the
initial participants poses a significant challenge. To address this, we
aim to collaborate with support groups and advocacy organizations like
Abortion Rights Advocacy Groups. These groups play a critical role in
connecting researchers with individuals who are otherwise difficult to
reach, particularly for sensitive topics like the impact of restrictive
abortion laws on maternal and infant health.

Therefore, the sample frame of our study will be mothers who live in
areas where they are unable to access abortion services due to
restrictive laws and have experienced the death of their infant within
the first year of life in states with abortion bans following the Dobbs
decision and are reachable and can be contacted by Abortion Rights
Advocacy Groups.

## Sample

We plan to survey 20 respondents for this study. Our sample will consist
of mothers who fit the defined sample frame—those who were unable to
access abortion services due to restrictive laws, experienced the death
of their infant within the first year of life, and are reachable through
Abortion Rights Advocacy Groups. These mothers must also be willing to
participate in and answer our survey questions, ensuring the reliability
and depth of the collected data. write recruitment of respondents

Recruitment of Respondents
Recruiting participants for this sensitive study requires a carefully designed approach that respects privacy, builds trust, and ensures voluntary participation. To reach our target population, we will collaborate with trusted support groups and advocacy organizations, such as Abortion Rights Advocacy Groups, that work directly with women affected by restrictive abortion laws. These organizations serve as a bridge, connecting researchers with individuals who might otherwise be difficult to reach due to the personal and sensitive nature of the topic.

The recruitment process will involve the following steps:

Partnership with Organizations: We will establish partnerships with advocacy groups and support organizations that have existing relationships with women in our target population. These organizations will be instrumental in identifying and reaching potential participants.

Outreach and Communication: Through these partnerships, we will create outreach materials explaining the purpose of the study, emphasizing confidentiality, and outlining the importance of participation in improving health services and policy. These materials will be distributed through email, newsletters, social media, and community events organized by these groups.

Screening and Consent: Interested individuals will undergo an initial screening process to ensure they meet the inclusion criteria of the study. Participants will then provide informed consent, acknowledging their understanding of the study's purpose, their rights as participants, and the voluntary nature of their involvement.

Anonymous Participation: To respect privacy and minimize potential discomfort, we will offer participants the option to complete the survey anonymously. They can choose their preferred method of participation, whether online, via phone, or in person, based on their comfort level.

Support and Resources: Recognizing the sensitive nature of the topic, we will provide participants with access to mental health resources and support services both during and after their participation. These resources will be shared upfront to ensure participants feel supported throughout the process.

By working closely with advocacy groups and maintaining a participant-centered approach, we aim to build trust and foster meaningful engagement, ensuring the collection of reliable and impactful data.

Handling Non-Response Bias
Non-response bias is a critical consideration in this study, particularly given the sensitive nature of the topic and the challenges in reaching our target population. To mitigate its potential impact, we will implement the following strategies:

Engagement through Trusted Channels: Collaborating with trusted support groups and advocacy organizations ensures participants feel comfortable and valued, increasing the likelihood of response.

Confidentiality and Anonymity: Emphasizing the confidential nature of responses and offering an anonymous online survey option can help reduce hesitancy to participate.

Follow-Up Reminders: For participants who express interest but do not complete the survey, polite and non-intrusive reminders will be sent to encourage completion.

Incentives for Participation: Providing small, non-coercive incentives, such as access to additional mental health resources, can motivate participation without influencing responses.

Weighting Responses: To address any potential bias due to non-response, we will weight survey responses based on demographic data to ensure representativeness relative to the sample frame.

Sensitivity Analysis: We will conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of non-response on our results, ensuring that findings remain robust under different assumptions about non-respondents.

By implementing these measures, we aim to minimize non-response bias and ensure the reliability and validity of the study’s findings.

As part of the RDS methodology, participants may also invite others from their network who share similar experiences, ensuring the sample expands while maintaining anonymity. Interested participants will undergo a screening process and provide informed consent, with the option to complete the survey anonymously online, ensuring safety and confidentiality. To support participant well-being, we will provide access to mental health resources throughout the process, fostering trust and encouraging meaningful participation.

Handling Non-Response Bias in RDS Sampling

Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is a non-probability sampling method designed for hard-to-reach populations, such as mothers impacted by restrictive abortion laws. However, non-response bias remains a potential concern. To address this, we will implement the following strategies:

Chain Referral Incentives: RDS includes dual incentives to encourage participation—one for completing the survey and another for successfully recruiting eligible peers. This approach ensures broader network engagement and mitigates non-response at initial recruitment stages.

Flexible Participation Options: Surveys will be designed for online completion, allowing participants to respond anonymously at their convenience, reducing barriers such as time constraints or stigma.

Collaboration with Trusted Organizations: By working with advocacy groups and support networks, we ensure participants are contacted through familiar and trusted channels, which helps build confidence in the study and encourages response.

Adjusting Weights: To account for differences in recruitment success and participation rates across various demographics, RDS-adjusted weights will be applied to the analysis, improving representativeness and minimizing bias in the final data.

These measures aim to reduce the impact of non-response bias while leveraging RDS's strength in reaching hidden populations.

To address non-response bias in our Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) approach, we will use dual incentives to encourage participation and peer recruitment, ensuring broader network engagement. Surveys will be available online for anonymous and flexible completion, reducing barriers such as stigma or time constraints. Partnering with trusted advocacy groups will foster trust and improve response rates. To enhance representativeness, RDS-adjusted weights will account for demographic differences in participation, minimizing bias and strengthening the reliability of our findings.

Handling non-response bias matters because it can skew survey results, leading to inaccurate
conclusions that do not accurately represent the entire population’s views or characteristics.
Given that our survey takes approximately 10 minutes to complete, there is a risk of nonresponse
bias. To mitigate this, as highlighted by Survey Monkey (2024), we set clear expectations
about the survey’s purpose and estimated completion time, encouraging participants to
stay engaged. Additionally, we apply post-stratification, adjusting survey weights to ensure
that our respondent group aligns closely with the actual population characteristics, reducing
bias, and improving representativeness (Kinga Edwards 2024).  this as example

Handling Non-Response Bias

Non-response bias is a concern as it can distort survey results and lead to unrepresentative conclusions about the target population. Since our survey addresses a sensitive topic and takes approximately 10–15 minutes to complete, there is a risk of participant dropout or refusal. To minimize this, we provide a clear overview of the survey's purpose, confidentiality measures, and estimated completion time, fostering trust and encouraging participation. Additionally, using RDS-adjusted weights ensures our final sample reflects the broader target population, improving representativeness and reducing bias.

ChatGPT
Respondent Validation

To ensure the credibility of our data, we implement a respondent validation process. Participants will undergo an initial screening to confirm they meet the study criteria, such as being unable to access abortion services due to restrictive laws and experiencing the loss of an infant within the first year of life. Responses will be reviewed for completeness and consistency, and duplicate entries will be removed to maintain data integrity. Collaboration with trusted support groups and advocacy organizations further enhances respondent reliability, ensuring that our findings accurately reflect the experiences of the target population.

Our online survey is carefully designed to minimize social desirability bias (SDB) while addressing the sensitivity of the topic. The survey begins with a clear introduction explaining its purpose—academic research on the impact of restrictive abortion laws—while emphasizing respondent anonymity and confidentiality. Before sensitive questions, participants are reassured that their responses are entirely confidential and will only be used for research purposes. The anonymous online format provides a safe space for participants to share their experiences without fear of judgment or stigma. Additionally, a feedback section at the end invites respondents to voice any concerns or share additional thoughts, fostering trust and enhancing the quality of the data collected.

We tested a new introduction before the pregnancy outcome; well‐designed introductions are a potential tool for improving reporting of sensitive behaviors. 19 , 46 The NSFG has tried different introductions over time but not in an experimental format. 47 , 48 In the cognitive interviews, we asked respondents whether they would want to see an introduction before a question about their abortion history. The majority felt that an introduction should be present to ease respondents into the question and explain the question motivation. However, many respondents did not like the current NSFG “reluctant” introduction; respondents often felt that the language and terminology used were negative and might discourage reporting. Instead, we explored five alternative introductions in cognitive interviews and the pilot survey. These studies found that respondents most preferred an introduction that focused on how sharing their abortion experience in a survey could help improve health services for other women. 35 This informed the design for this study of an introduction that uses the “helping” framework. We hypothesized this introduction could improve reporting by increasing survey participants' motivation to respond accurately and help others. 19 write this as a sentence

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
The CDC's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) system offers an API that enables automated data queries across its online databases. This API facilitates the integration of public health data into various applications and services.

Key Features of the CDC WONDER API:

Data Retrieval: Access data from WONDER's online databases through automated queries in XML format over HTTP. This allows for seamless integration into web pages or widgets. 
Wonder

Request Structure: Send a POST request to the WONDER server with a parameter named request_xml, containing the XML document that specifies your query criteria. Each database has a unique ID and set of parameters. For example, the Detailed Mortality database uses the ID D76. 
Wonder

Data Use Agreement: All access to data via the API requires consent to CDC's data use restrictions. This consent can be included within the XML request or as a separate POST parameter. 
Wonder

Response Format: The API returns results as an XML document, which includes the data table along with relevant caveats and footnotes. All data use restrictions are enforced and apply to these data. 
Wonder

Additional Resources:

API Utility: For users without a preferred method to send requests, the CDC provides a Java-based utility to interact with the API. This utility requires the ability to compile and run Java programs. 
Wonder

Examples and Documentation: Detailed examples of request and response XML documents are available to guide users in formulating their queries. These examples demonstrate how to structure requests for specific datasets, such as national cancer deaths by year and race. 
Wonder

so how to request dataset in r?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To request datasets from the CDC WONDER API in R, you can use the httr or httr2 package to send HTTP POST requests and parse the returned XML data. Here’s how you can do it step-by-step:

1. Install Required Packages
install.packages(c("httr", "xml2", "tidyverse"))
2. Prepare the Request XML
The CDC WONDER API requires you to send a POST request containing an XML payload. First, construct the XML request following the API documentation for the specific dataset you want to access.

For example, for the Detailed Mortality database:

request_xml <- '
<D76Request>
    <D76Header>
        <DS>D76</DS>
        <VS>2019</VS>
    </D76Header>
    <D76Filter>
        <AND>
            <Year>2019</Year>
        </AND>
    </D76Filter>
</D76Request>
'
3. Send the API Request
Use the httr package to send the request.

library(httr)

# Define the URL for the API
url <- "https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76"

# Send POST request
response <- POST(url, body = list(request_xml = request_xml), encode = "form")

# Check the response
if (status_code(response) == 200) {
  cat("Request Successful!")
} else {
  cat("Request Failed: ", status_code(response))
}
4. Parse the Response
The API returns an XML document containing the requested data. Use the xml2 package to parse and extract the data.

library(xml2)

# Parse the XML response
response_content <- content(response, "text")
parsed_xml <- read_xml(response_content)

# Extract data table from XML
data_nodes <- xml_find_all(parsed_xml, "//row")

# Convert to a data frame
data <- data.frame(
  Year = xml_text(xml_find_all(data_nodes, ".//Year")),
  Deaths = xml_text(xml_find_all(data_nodes, ".//Deaths"))
)
5. Refine and Analyze Data
Convert the extracted data into a tidy format for analysis.

library(tidyverse)

# Convert columns to appropriate data types
data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    Year = as.numeric(Year),
    Deaths = as.numeric(Deaths)
  )

# View data
print(data)
Example Output:
Year	Deaths
2019	100
2018	200
Additional Notes:
Customize Request XML: Modify the XML template according to your needs (e.g., change the year, state, or filters).
Authentication: The CDC WONDER API requires a data-use agreement. Include the <Login> section in your XML if needed.
Error Handling: Check for errors in the API response and handle them in your code.

It looks like you’ve uploaded XML files related to the "Linked Birth and Infant Death Records" dataset for the years 2017-2022. Would you like me to:

Inspect the XML files to understand their structure?
Assist you in creating or modifying an API request using these files?
Parse and analyze the content of the XML files in R or Python?
Let me know how you'd like to proceed!






You said:

Based on the content of the uploaded files, we have the following:

Response XML (*-resp.xml): This file appears to contain metadata about the dataset, such as variable definitions, hierarchical levels, and configuration settings.
Request Parameters XML (*-req.xml): This file contains a structured list of query parameters (e.g., variable codes and filters) used to query the CDC WONDER API.
Here’s how you can integrate these into an R script to make an API request:

R Script for API Request
1. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

install.packages(c("httr", "xml2"))
2. Construct the Request
Use the provided request XML to send a POST request:

library(httr)
library(xml2)

# Define the URL for the CDC WONDER API
url <- "https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D159"

# Load the request XML
request_xml <- readLines("path/to/Linked Birth  Infant Death Records, 2017-2022 Expanded_1731887485776-req.xml")
request_body <- paste(request_xml, collapse = "\n")

# Send the POST request
response <- POST(
  url,
  body = list(request_xml = request_body),
  encode = "form"
)

# Check response status
if (status_code(response) == 200) {
  cat("Request successful!\n")
} else {
  cat("Request failed with status: ", status_code(response), "\n")
}
3. Parse the Response
The response is in XML format. Use xml2 to parse and extract the data:

# Parse the response content
response_content <- content(response, as = "text", encoding = "UTF-8")
parsed_xml <- read_xml(response_content)

# Extract rows of data
data_nodes <- xml_find_all(parsed_xml, "//row")

# Example: Extract specific fields from the XML
data <- data.frame(
  Variable1 = xml_text(xml_find_all(data_nodes, ".//Variable1")),
  Variable2 = xml_text(xml_find_all(data_nodes, ".//Variable2"))
)

# View the data
print(data)
Notes:
Replace "path/to/...-req.xml" with the actual path to your request XML file.
Modify xml_find_all() to match the actual field names in your dataset. You can inspect these using xml_find_all(parsed_xml, "//*") to explore the structure.
Ensure the data-use agreement is acknowledged in your request XML if required.
Let me know if you’d like help refining the script further or exploring specific data fields! ​​

A 500 Internal Server Error typically means the server encountered an issue processing your request. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Validate the XML Syntax
Ensure your request_xml is well-formed. Common issues include:
Unescaped special characters (e.g., &, <, >).
Unclosed tags.
Validate your XML using an online XML validator.
2. Check Mandatory Fields
The CDC WONDER API requires specific fields to be filled correctly. Ensure:

The dataset code (D159 in your case) is valid and matches the intended dataset.
Required filters and parameters are included.
Any mandatory fields are properly populated.
3. Simplify the Request
Try submitting a simpler request to isolate the issue:

request_xml <- '
<request-parameters>
    <parameter>
        <name>dataset_code</name>
        <value>D159</value>
    </parameter>
    <parameter>
        <name>action-Send</name>
        <value>Send</value>
    </parameter>
</request-parameters>
'
If this works, gradually add more parameters to identify the problem.

4. Review Field Values
Verify that values such as *All*, D159.V10, and others are valid for the dataset.
Double-check documentation for restrictions on values or combinations of parameters.
5. Check the API Endpoint
Ensure you are sending the request to the correct URL:
https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D159
Confirm that the API supports the dataset and parameters specified.
6. Include the Data-Use Agreement
If the dataset requires acceptance of a data-use agreement, include the following parameter:

<parameter>
    <name>accept_terms</name>
    <value>yes</value>
</parameter>
Debugging Example in R:
library(httr)

url <- "https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D159"

response <- POST(
  url,
  body = list(request_xml = request_xml),
  encode = "form"
)

# Check for HTTP errors
if (http_error(response)) {
  cat("Error: ", http_status(response)$message, "\n")
  print(content(response, "text"))
} else {
  cat("Request Successful!\n")
  print(content(response, "text"))
}
If you continue to encounter the 500 error, I recommend testing with the simplest valid request and gradually building up complexity, or contacting CDC WONDER support for clarification on the API requirements for your dataset.

Our study primarily relies on observational data to analyze the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the United States following the Dobbs decision. While observational data provide valuable insights, they are subject to inherent limitations, such as confounding factors and challenges in establishing causal relationships. To address these limitations and enrich our study, we propose incorporating a survey to complement the observational data, providing a deeper understanding of how restrictive abortion policies influence maternal health, healthcare access, and infant outcomes.

## Introduction
Understanding the nuanced impacts of abortion bans and the overturn of Roe v. Wade on infant mortality rates requires a deeper exploration of the lived experiences of affected populations. Survey-based qualitative studies provide an opportunity to examine how restrictive abortion policies influence maternal health, healthcare access, and family well-being, going beyond the numbers presented by quantitative data.

This study proposes to examine the psychological and social dimensions of abortion bans by conducting surveys with mothers who were unable to access abortion services and subsequently experienced the death of their infant. Restrictive abortion laws may profoundly impact a mother’s psychological condition, particularly in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies. Stress, anxiety, or depression arising from forced pregnancies or the inability to terminate a pregnancy can significantly compromise maternal mental health.

These psychological challenges may, in turn, influence prenatal care decisions, access to healthcare, and overall maternal behavior during pregnancy—factors that are critical to the survival and health of the infant. Surveying affected mothers offers an opportunity to understand their lived experiences, including the mental health struggles, societal pressures, and systemic barriers they faced. The insights gained from these surveys can shed light on the cascading effects of restrictive abortion policies on maternal and infant health outcomes.

By also involving healthcare providers and support organizations, the survey aims to capture a holistic view of how systemic challenges and individual experiences intersect. These findings will help inform evidence-based interventions to address the psychological and healthcare needs of mothers and mitigate the adverse outcomes associated with abortion bans. This approach underscores the importance of combining quantitative data with qualitative insights to fully understand and address the broader implications of restrictive abortion laws. polish, concise

Here’s a more polished and concise version of your text:

Introduction
This study explores the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the United States following the Dobbs decision, using a combination of observational data and survey-based research. While observational data highlight trends, they face inherent limitations, such as confounding factors and difficulties in establishing causality. To address these gaps, we propose incorporating surveys to better understand how restrictive abortion policies influence maternal health, healthcare access, and infant outcomes.

The survey will focus on mothers unable to access abortion services who subsequently experienced the death of their infant. Restrictive abortion laws may exacerbate maternal stress, anxiety, or depression—especially in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies—potentially undermining maternal health and prenatal care. By documenting their experiences, we aim to understand how psychological challenges, societal pressures, and systemic barriers contribute to adverse outcomes.

Additionally, the survey will involve healthcare providers and support organizations to offer a holistic perspective on the intersection of systemic challenges and individual experiences. This dual approach seeks to inform evidence-based interventions that address maternal psychological and healthcare needs, ultimately reducing the negative consequences of abortion bans.

By combining quantitative and qualitative methods, this study provides a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between restrictive abortion policies and maternal and infant health, advancing the foundation for effective policy responses.

This version maintains the essential details while improving clarity and flow.

Survey Plan: Examining the Impact of Abortion Bans on Infant Mortality Rates
1. Objectives
Explore how restrictive abortion policies influence maternal mental health, healthcare access, and infant outcomes.
Examine the lived experiences of mothers affected by abortion bans and their impact on decision-making and health outcomes.
Understand systemic barriers through the perspectives of healthcare providers and support organizations.
2. Target Population
Primary Group:
Mothers who:

Were unable to access abortion services due to abortion bans.
Subsequently experienced the death of their infant within the first year of life.
Secondary Group:

Healthcare providers (e.g., obstetricians, midwives, social workers) involved in maternal and infant care.
Representatives from support organizations (e.g., nonprofits addressing maternal health or abortion access).
3. Sampling Strategy
Recruitment:
Leverage support organizations, maternal health clinics, and social media platforms to identify participants.

Introduction
Restrictive abortion laws may exacerbate maternal stress, anxiety, or depression—especially in cases of unintended or high-risk pregnancies—potentially undermining maternal health and prenatal care. Research indicates that maternal mental health is a critical determinant of infant health outcomes, as conditions such as chronic stress, depression, or anxiety during pregnancy can negatively impact prenatal behaviors, access to healthcare, and overall maternal well-being. These psychological challenges, compounded by societal pressures and systemic barriers, can significantly increase the risk of adverse infant outcomes, including infant mortality. The survey will focus on mothers unable to access abortion services who subsequently experienced the death of their infant, documenting their experiences to better understand these interconnected factors.

To provide a comprehensive perspective, the study will also involve healthcare providers and support organizations, capturing insights into systemic challenges and the broader impacts of abortion bans on family healthcare.

This study examines the impact of abortion bans on infant mortality rates in the United States following the Dobbs decision, employing both observational data and survey-based research. Observational data provide quantitative insights, revealing trends and associations across large populations. However, they often fall short in addressing underlying mechanisms due to limitations such as confounding factors and challenges in establishing causality.

To address these gaps, we propose incorporating surveys to gather qualitative data, which provide rich, detailed accounts of individual experiences and contextual factors. Qualitative methods allow for a deeper understanding of how restrictive abortion policies affect maternal health, access to healthcare, and infant outcomes, capturing nuances that quantitative analysis alone cannot.

By combining quantitative and qualitative approaches, this study leverages the strengths of both methods. Quantitative data offer generalizable findings and statistical rigor, while qualitative data provide depth and context to interpret those findings. Together, they create a more comprehensive framework for understanding the complex relationship between restrictive abortion policies, maternal health, and infant outcomes, enabling the development of nuanced, evidence-based interventions and policy recommendations.
